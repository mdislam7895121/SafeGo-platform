You are now working in my main SafeGo app repository (the one with the full backend and the /ride booking + tracking flows). The goal is:

> Make the marketing landing page and the ride app live on the SAME project and SAME domain.

Do NOT touch the backend contracts or database. Do NOT redesign the UI of the ride map or dashboards. Only do routing + landing wiring.

High-level requirements

1. The root path `/` must show the SafeGo marketing landing page (hero, services, partner cards, how it works, safety, FAQ, final CTA).
2. The same React app must also handle `/ride`, `/drive`, `/business`, etc. using our existing booking/tracking implementation and auth logic.
3. All navigation and buttons on the landing page must link to INTERNAL routes (no external domain, no 404).

Assume this is a React + TypeScript app with a `client/src` folder and existing pages like:

- `client/src/pages/customer/ride-request-page.tsx` (or an equivalent ride page)
- `client/src/pages/customer/ride-tracking-page.tsx`
- A central router (e.g. `client/src/main.tsx`, `client/src/router.tsx`, or similar)

Follow these steps exactly.

────────────────
1. Create the Landing page component
────────────────

1.1. Create a new page component for the landing page:

- File: `client/src/pages/landing/LandingPage.tsx` (or another appropriate folder, but keep it under `client/src/pages`).
- Export a default `LandingPage` React component.

1.2. Inside `LandingPage.tsx`, build the content using our existing design structure from the current SafeGo marketing site:

Sections to include (in this order):

- Hero:
  - Left: “Move, eat, and deliver with SafeGo” style heading.
  - Sub-text: “One platform for rides, food delivery, and parcel delivery — launching first in Bangladesh.”
  - Two buttons:
    - Primary: “Explore services”
    - Secondary: “Become a partner”
- SafeGo Services:
  - Cards for: Rides, Food delivery, Parcel delivery, Local Shops, Tickets & Travel (if already in the copy).
- Become a partner:
  - Two columns: “For drivers & couriers” and “For restaurants & shops”.
- How SafeGo works:
  - Three flows: Rides, Food delivery, Parcel delivery (step-by-step bullets).
- Safety & Security:
  - Columns for “Your safety comes first”, “Safety while you work”, “Protecting your data and privacy”.
- Support & FAQ:
  - FAQ cards (How do I request a SafeGo ride? When is SafeGo launching? How do I become a driver or courier? etc.).
- Final CTA:
  - “Ready to move with SafeGo?” section with buttons:
    - “Download the app”
    - “Become a partner”

Use our existing design primitives:

- Buttons, cards, typography, and layout components from `client/src/components` instead of inventing new styling systems.
- Keep the visual layout similar to the current marketing site, but you do NOT need pixel-perfect reproduction. Prioritize clean, consistent structure.

Important: This is a purely static marketing page. Do NOT add any new API calls here.

────────────────
2. Wire the root route `/` to the Landing page
────────────────

2.1. Find our main router configuration. It will be in one of these files:

- `client/src/main.tsx`
- `client/src/router.tsx`
- `client/src/App.tsx`
- Or a similar routing entrypoint.

2.2. Add a route for `/` that renders `LandingPage`:

- If using React Router:

  - Import `LandingPage` from `client/src/pages/landing/LandingPage`.
  - Add a route: `{ path: "/", element: <LandingPage /> }` as the top-level public route.
  - Do NOT break existing routes, especially `/ride`, `/customer/...`, `/driver/...`, `/admin/...`.

- If using a custom router structure, follow the existing pattern for pages to make `/` show the landing component.

2.3. Ensure that the existing `/ride` booking page continues to work exactly as before. Do NOT move or rename the ride booking files.

────────────────
3. Update the top navigation to use internal routes
────────────────

3.1. Find the main header / navbar component used by the landing site:

- Likely in something like `client/src/components/layout/Header.tsx`, `Navbar.tsx`, or `client/src/components/marketing/TopNav.tsx`.

3.2. Make sure the navbar uses internal routing (React Router `<Link>` or equivalent) instead of hardcoded full URLs.

Update the nav items to:

- Logo: links to `/`
- “Ride”: links to `/ride`
- “Drive”: links to `/drive` (or `/drivers/signup` if that’s the driver entry in this app)
- “Business”: links to `/business` (or an existing partner/merchant entry page)
- “About”: link to an existing about page route if present; otherwise keep it pointing to `/#how-it-works` anchor on the landing page.

3.3. Right-side buttons:

- “Login” → link to `/auth/login` (or the correct login route in this project).
- “Sign up” → link to `/auth/signup` (customer signup route).

Do NOT use `SAFEGO_APP_BASE_URL` or any external domain here. These should be internal app links.

────────────────
4. Wire CTA buttons to the internal app
────────────────

In `LandingPage.tsx`, connect all call-to-action buttons to internal routes:

- Hero:
  - “Explore services” → `/ride`
  - “Become a partner” → `/drive` or `/partners` (choose the route we already have for partner onboarding).
- SafeGo Services cards:
  - “Rides” → `/ride`
  - “Food delivery” → existing customer food ordering entry route (e.g. `/customer/food` or `/eats` if such a route exists).
  - “Parcel delivery” → parcel request route (e.g. `/customer/parcel`).
  - “Local Shops” → the shops/basket entry page (if implemented).
  - “Tickets & Travel” → existing ticket search page, if it exists; otherwise leave as a non-clickable label.
- Become a partner section:
  - “Earn as a SafeGo driver or delivery partner” → driver signup route (`/driver/signup` or the correct driver onboarding entry).
  - “Grow your restaurant or shop with SafeGo” → restaurant/shop partner signup route (`/restaurant/signup` or equivalent).
- Final CTA:
  - “Download the app” → keep as placeholder or external store link if already configured.
  - “Become a partner” → same as above partner route.

Again: NO external hardcoded `https://safegoglobal.com/drive` links. Always use internal React routing.

────────────────
5. Region tabs (Bangladesh / United States / Global)
────────────────

5.1. The landing hero has region tabs like:

- Bangladesh
- United States
- Global

Connect these to our existing region / country handling WITHOUT breaking the ride flows:

- If we already have a `RegionContext`, `useRegion()` hook, or similar:

  - Use it so that clicking “Bangladesh” sets region to “BD”, “United States” sets region to “US”, and “Global” to `"GLOBAL"` or the value used in our app.
  - Make sure this region is consistent with what the `/ride` page already uses for BD vs US rules.

- If there is NO region context yet in this project:

  - Implement the simplest possible solution:
    - Store the selected region in `localStorage` and/or URL query parameter `?region=BD` / `?region=US`.
    - Ensure that the existing `/ride` booking page reads the same region source it currently uses (do not rewrite ride logic, just reuse its region detection if it exists).
  - Do NOT add new backend endpoints for region.

The visual design of the tabs must stay the same; only behavior should update.

────────────────
6. Clean up external base URL usage for landing → app
────────────────

6.1. Search the entire project for any constant or usage of `SAFEGO_APP_BASE_URL` or similar variables that build full URLs for `/ride`, `/drive`, etc.

- If these are only used in the landing / CTA components, refactor them to internal routing and remove those references.
- If some external integration still needs them (for example, external emails or PDFs), keep them only in those back-office places and NOT in the main landing UI.

The public web navigation should not generate `https://safegoglobal.com/ride` manually. It should rely on the same React routing that powers the app pages.

────────────────
7. Verification checklist
────────────────

After you finish, verify the following inside this ONE project:

1. `/` loads the new SafeGo landing page with all sections.
2. `/ride` still loads the fully functional ride booking map and backend integration.
3. Clicking “Explore services” on the hero correctly goes to `/ride` with no 404.
4. Clicking “Become a partner” goes to the correct driver/partner entry page.
5. The top navigation “Ride”, “Drive”, “Business”, “About”, “Login”, “Sign up” all work and stay inside the same app (no full page 404 from another project).
6. The region tabs switch the region state in a way that the `/ride` page can read (BD vs US rules), without breaking any existing BD/US logic.
7. There are no references in the landing code to external hardcoded `safegoglobal.com/...` routes for internal navigation.

Do NOT change:

- Backend endpoints or their contracts.
- Auth logic or token handling.
- The existing ride map layout or booking UX.

Only add the landing page page/component, routes, and internal links described above, so that SafeGo’s marketing landing and the operational app share one domain and one codebase.
