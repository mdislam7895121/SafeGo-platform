PHASE 1 – SafeGo Eats Restaurant Dashboard Layout (NON-BREAKING)

GOAL:
Redesign ONLY the Restaurant Dashboard home page into a professional SafeGo Eats layout (Uber Eats–style) with header and KPI summary. Do NOT touch other roles or modules.

SCOPE:
- Only restaurant dashboard route (current "/restaurant" or equivalent)
- No DB schema changes
- No changes to driver/rider/parcel flows
- Reuse existing design system (SafeGo styles, colors, buttons)

REQUIREMENTS:

1) TOP HEADER (SafeGo Eats Branding)
- Show:
  - Restaurant name
  - City (if available) or “Location pending”
  - Restaurant ID (small text)
  - Status chip: "Verified & Active" / "Pending Verification" / "Inactive"
  - ONLINE/OFFLINE toggle:
    - Online label: “You’re receiving orders”
    - Offline label: “Not receiving orders right now”
- Keep "Logout" button as is.
- Use existing status from backend; do NOT invent new fields.

2) KPI SUMMARY ROW (4 CARDS)
Add a 4-card row directly under header:
  1) Today’s Orders
     - Count of orders for today for this restaurant
  2) Today’s Earnings
     - Restaurant earnings AFTER SafeGo service fee (reuse existing fields)
  3) Active Orders
     - Current orders with a non-terminal status (e.g., NEW/PREPARING/READY)
  4) Restaurant Rating
     - Average rating + total rating count (if exists; else show “No ratings yet”)

Empty state rule:
- If any metric missing (no data yet), show “—” and a small hint text instead of breaking the UI.

3) TWO-COLUMN LAYOUT SHELL
Prepare the base layout structure:
- Left column placeholder: “Live Orders” area (for Phase 2)
- Right column placeholder: Info + Wallet + Quick actions (for later phases)

For now:
- Left column: simple card “Live Orders will appear here once implemented (Phase 2).”
- Right column:
  - Card: “Restaurant Information” (current info)
  - Card: “Wallet Snapshot (coming soon)” placeholder
  - Card: “Quick Actions (coming soon)” placeholder

4) RESPONSIVE DESIGN
- Ensure layout works on desktop, tablet, mobile.
- On mobile, stack KPIs and columns vertically without horizontal scroll.

5) SAFETY & NON-BREAKING RULES
- Do NOT change APIs.
- Do NOT remove existing components that other pages depend on.
- Only refactor the restaurant dashboard view and its local components.
- Keep all authentication/authorization logic exactly as is.

DELIVERABLE:
- Updated restaurant dashboard page with:
  - New header
  - KPI summary row
  - Two-column shell with placeholders
- Show me in the UI and in a short summary which files were changed.
