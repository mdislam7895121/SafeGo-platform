STOP. You must immediately revert and rebuild the Delivery Driver onboarding flow.  
Your current implementation violates SafeGo Master Rules by using a simplified 3-step onboarding.  
This is NOT allowed.

REQUIREMENT:  
Rebuild the FULL 7-STEP DRIVER ONBOARDING WIZARD exactly as required below.  
This is mandatory and non-negotiable.

=====================================================
MANDATORY 7-STEP ONBOARDING WIZARD  
(Apply country-specific BD/US KYC rules)

Step 1 — Select Country (BD or US)
Step 2 — Personal Info (dynamic by country)
Step 3 — Address Info
Step 4 — Government ID Upload
Step 5 — Delivery Method (US only: car, bike, walking)
Step 6 — Vehicle Documents (car only; bike/walking skip)
Step 7 — Final Review → Submit → verification_status = "pending"

=====================================================
YOU MUST REMOVE your simplified onboarding.  
YOU MUST FOLLOW the official SafeGo required fields:

You must implement SafeGo Master Rules EXACTLY.

After implementing:

Everything must be publish-ready and fully aligned with SafeGo rules.

DO NOT continue with shortcuts.  
Rebuild the full correct system now.
