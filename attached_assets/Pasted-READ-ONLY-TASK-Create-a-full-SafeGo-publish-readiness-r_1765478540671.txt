READ-ONLY TASK: Create a full SafeGo publish-readiness report without modifying any code.

Goal:
Audit the entire SafeGo system (backend + admin + customer/partner apps) and produce a detailed report about what is READY, PARTIAL, or MISSING before we can safely publish the platform.

Hard rules (very important):
- This is a READ-ONLY task.
- Do NOT modify, refactor, or delete any code, config, routes, or database schemas.
- Do NOT change landing pages, dashboards, or business logic.
- Only read files, environment variables, and existing database models, then write a report.

Output:
Create a new Markdown report file:
- docs/publish_readiness_report.md

In that report, check and document the following sections.

1) Roles coverage (Customer, Driver, Restaurant, Admin)
   For each role, list:
   - Existing signup / login or onboarding flows
   - Country-specific KYC handling (BD vs US)
   - Dashboards / pages that exist
   - Permissions and restrictions (what each role can see/do)
   - Status flows they interact with
   Mark each role as: READY, PARTIAL, or MISSING for BD and US separately.

2) Services coverage (Ride, Food, Parcel) + BD shop & ticket
   For each service:
   - Confirm routes, controllers, and UI exist for:
     - Customer booking / ordering
     - Driver or courier flow (where applicable)
     - Restaurant / merchant management (for food)
   - Confirm that BD and US rules are respected (e.g., BD + US ride-hailing, BD-only shop/ticket).
   Mark: READY / PARTIAL / MISSING per country (BD, US).

3) Country-specific KYC rules (BD vs US)
   Confirm in code and database models that:

   Bangladesh (BD) requires:
   - father_name
   - date_of_birth
   - present_address
   - permanent_address
   - NID (number + front/back images)
   - emergency contact details
   - verification_status + is_verified

   United States (US) requires:
   - date_of_birth
   - home_address
   - emergency contact details
   - government_id_type
   - government_id_last4
   - (drivers) driver license + image + expiry
   - (drivers) ssn_last4 (optional)
   - verification_status + is_verified

   For each role and country, state whether these fields and flows are:
   READY / PARTIAL / MISSING.

4) Admin panel capabilities
   In the code and routes, verify Admin can:
   - Verify customers, drivers, restaurants
   - Approve/reject KYC with rejection_reason
   - Update pricing, fees, commissions
   - Block/unblock any user
   - Manage payouts and settlements
   - View driver negative balance
   - View restaurant negative balance
   For each item, mark READY / PARTIAL / MISSING and point to the relevant files/routes.

5) Core collections: rides, food_orders, deliveries
   For each collection (and any related ORM models), confirm they include:
   - Identity fields (customer_id, driver_id, restaurant_id where relevant)
   - Addresses + geolocation
   - Fees + commission fields
   - Payment details (cash vs online, gateway references, transaction IDs)
   - Timestamps (created_at, updated_at, status history)
   - Status flow fields
   - Rating and feedback fields

   Document the exact model names and files, and mark each collection as:
   READY / PARTIAL / MISSING.

6) Commission & payout rules
   Verify in code that the following rules are implemented:

   - If customer pays CASH (rides/parcel):
     - Driver receives full cash
     - SafeGo commission becomes negative balance in driver_wallet_balance
     - Driver must settle weekly

   - If food order is CASH:
     - Restaurant gets all cash
     - Commission becomes negative balance in restaurant_wallet

   - If payment is ONLINE:
     - SafeGo keeps commission automatically

   - Admin can settle balances and mark paid.

   For each service (ride/food/parcel, BD & US), describe where this logic lives and whether it is:
   READY / PARTIAL / MISSING.

7) Security & privacy rules
   Check the codebase for enforcement that:
   - Customers cannot view driver documents (NID, license, etc.)
   - Drivers cannot view customer NID or other sensitive info
   - Restaurants cannot view other restaurants’ data
   - Only admin can change pricing, commissions, verification, and blocking
   - Users can update only their own profile

   For each rule, document:
   - How it is enforced (middleware, policy, checks)
   - Any gaps or TODOs
   Mark: READY / PARTIAL / MISSING.

8) Status flows

   Ride statuses:
   - requested → searching_driver → accepted → driver_arriving → in_progress → completed or cancelled_x

   Food statuses:
   - placed → accepted → preparing → ready_for_pickup → picked_up → on_the_way → delivered or cancelled_x

   Parcel statuses:
   - requested → searching_driver → accepted → picked_up → on_the_way → delivered or cancelled_x

   For each flow:
   - Confirm the statuses exist in models/enums
   - Confirm there are API endpoints or handlers for each transition
   - Confirm admin/customer/driver views show these states
   Mark each flow per country as: READY / PARTIAL / MISSING.

9) Onboarding flows
   For each role (customer, driver, restaurant, admin helpers where relevant):
   - Confirm multi-step onboarding:
     - Basic info
     - Address
     - ID/KYC upload (country-specific)
     - Emergency contact
     - verification_status = "pending"
   - Confirm access is blocked until approved by admin.
   Mark per-role and per-country: READY / PARTIAL / MISSING.

10) Notifications
   Verify that the system has notification mechanisms (email, in-app, etc.) for:
   - New ride alert for driver
   - Order updates (food)
   - Parcel updates
   - Verification approval/rejection
   - Important admin notifications

   For each type, document:
   - Implementation (which services/files)
   - Channel (email, in-app, SMS if any)
   - Status: READY / PARTIAL / MISSING.

11) Payment gateways & environments
   Confirm configuration for:

   - Bangladesh:
     - SSLCommerz sandbox credentials (store ID, password)
     - Callback URLs for success/fail/cancel/IPN
     - Feature flags:
       - SSLcommerz sandbox vs production
       - Feature flag enabling BD online payments

   - United States:
     - Stripe integration (sandbox/test mode)
     - Webhook endpoints and secret keys
     - Admin configuration pages for US online payments

   For each gateway and country, mark:
   - Sandbox READY? (yes/no)
   - Production-ready? (yes/no, list missing items)

12) Final publish-readiness summary
   At the end of docs/publish_readiness_report.md, include a concise summary:

   - For Bangladesh:
     - Which services (ride, food, parcel, shop, ticket) are READY for a limited beta?
     - What exact items MUST be completed before a public launch?
   - For United States:
     - Which parts are not yet safe to publish?
     - Critical missing items that block launch.

   Use clear categories:
   - READY FOR BETA
   - NEEDS WORK BEFORE BETA
   - NOT IMPLEMENTED

Important:
- Do NOT change any code while doing this audit.
- If you see a bug or missing feature, only document it in the report; do not “fix” it in this task.
- When finished, tell me where the report file is and summarize the top 10 critical gaps for launch.
