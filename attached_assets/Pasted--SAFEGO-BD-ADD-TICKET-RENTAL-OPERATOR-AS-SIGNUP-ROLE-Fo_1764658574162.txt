# SAFEGO BD — ADD "TICKET & RENTAL OPERATOR" AS SIGNUP ROLE
# Follow ALL SafeGo master rules. Must be BD-only. No US impact.
# Do NOT break existing roles, schemas, or onboarding flows.

======================================================
A) PURPOSE
======================================================
Enable the "Ticket & Rental Operator" role to appear
in the signup role dropdown so BD users can register
as ticket operators.

This role already exists (dashboard, onboarding wizard,
KYC, BD-only logic, route management, schedule builder).
But it is not yet registered in the signup role selector.

Your job is to add it safely.

======================================================
B) ROLE NAME + LABEL (BANGLA FRIENDLY)
======================================================
Internal role ID:
  "ticket_operator"

Signup dropdown label (Bangla-first):
  "টিকিট ও রেন্টাল অপারেটর (Ticket Operator)"

This must appear ONLY when:
  countryCode === "BD"

US customers must NEVER see this.

======================================================
C) WHERE TO REGISTER
======================================================
Add this role to the frontend signup role list:

File to update (example):
  client/src/modules/auth/Signup.tsx
or the actual role registry file currently used.

Add “ticket_operator” as a selectable role,
with proper BD visibility guard.

Do NOT remove or modify existing roles:
- customer
- driver
- restaurant
- admin

======================================================
D) ONBOARDING ROUTING
======================================================
When this role is selected and signup completes:

Redirect to:
  /ticket-operator/onboarding

The existing 3-step BD onboarding wizard must load:
1) Operator info
2) Ticket settings
3) Rental settings

verification_status must default to "pending"
until admin approves in:
  /admin/bd-expansion/ticket-operators

======================================================
E) SECURITY RULES
======================================================
- Ticket operators cannot see customer sensitive data
- Customers cannot see operator documents
- Operators cannot access shop partner or restaurant routes
- Only admin can approve/reject ticket operator KYC

======================================================
F) NO BREAKING CHANGES
======================================================
Do NOT:
- modify backend schema
- modify ride/food/parcel modules
- modify customer/driver/restaurant signup logic
- change any field names

ONLY extend signup role list + routing.

======================================================
