Fix the SafeGo Driver navigation bugs so the UI behaves like a modern rideshare app (Uber-style). Focus only on driver web UI; do not change any business logic, RBAC, KYC, or payout rules.

Issues observed:
1) Driver sidebar (drawer) does not close after selecting a menu item.
   - On /driver/account and other driver pages, when the user taps the menu icon, the sidebar opens.
   - When the user taps an item like "Account", "Wallet", or "Performance", the page content changes, but the sidebar stays open and the user must tap again to close it.

2) Notification bell icon does nothing.
   - The bell icon with a badge (e.g., "3") is visible in the top bar, but tapping it does not open any notifications panel or page.

3) Globe icon (language/region) does nothing.
   - The globe icon in the header is meant for language/region selection, but tapping it has no visible effect.

Implementation requirements:

A. Sidebar / Drawer behavior
1. When the driver taps the menu icon and the sidebar opens, selecting ANY navigation item in the sidebar must:
   - Navigate to the correct route (existing behavior), AND
   - Automatically close the sidebar/drawer after navigation.
2. Make sure the following also close the sidebar:
   - Tapping on the dark overlay/background.
   - Pressing the Escape key on desktop.
3. Ensure this behavior is consistent on all driver routes that use the sidebar:
   - /driver/account
   - /driver/profile
   - /driver/wallet
   - /driver/documents
   - /driver/trips, /driver/performance, /driver/trust-score
   - /driver/support, /driver/settings, /driver/safety, etc.
4. Run an architect review to confirm:
   - Sidebar state is handled in a single source of truth (e.g., React state, context, or layout component).
   - There are no remaining cases where a menu item navigation leaves the drawer open.

B. Notification bell behavior
1. Implement a basic, non-destructive notifications UI for the driver:
   - Tapping the bell icon should open either:
     a) a small dropdown panel anchored under the bell, OR
     b) navigate to an existing notifications page like /driver/notifications if available.
   - The dropdown/panel can show a simple list of recent notifications with title, short message, and time. It can use mock/demo data if needed, but must be wired to the existing notification infrastructure if one already exists.
2. Make sure:
   - Tapping the bell again closes the dropdown.
   - Clicking outside the dropdown also closes it.
   - The badge count does not have to be fully dynamic, but should not break any existing logic.
3. Do NOT introduce any backend-breaking changes; keep this as a lightweight UI integration with existing APIs or placeholder data.

C. Globe (language/region) icon behavior
1. Connect the globe icon to the existing driver settings / preferences center:
   - When the driver taps the globe icon, open a small language/region selection dropdown OR navigate to the Driver Settings & Preferences Center with the Language tab focused.
   - Use the existing regionPreference / languagePreference fields that were already implemented.
2. At minimum, allow selecting between the currently supported languages/regions (e.g., English, default region), and make sure that:
   - The selection is stored using the existing settings mechanism.
   - Any text that already supports i18n reacts correctly when the preference changes (if implemented).
3. Ensure the globe icon has hover/focus states and an accessible label (e.g., aria-label="Language and region settings").

D. Verification
1. After implementing these changes, restart the application and verify:
   - From /driver/documents, open the sidebar, tap "Account": the account page loads and the sidebar closes automatically.
   - From /driver/account, tap the menu icon again: sidebar opens and closes correctly.
   - Tapping the bell icon shows a notification dropdown or navigates to the notifications page.
   - Tapping the globe icon opens the language/region UI or navigates to the settings screen with the language section visible.
2. Take screenshots of:
   - The driver account page with the sidebar closed.
   - The sidebar open state.
   - The notifications dropdown or notifications page.
   - The language/region selection UI.

Do not modify any payout, KYC, wallet, or security logic. This task is strictly about fixing navigation UX for the driver so it behaves like a professional rideshare app.
