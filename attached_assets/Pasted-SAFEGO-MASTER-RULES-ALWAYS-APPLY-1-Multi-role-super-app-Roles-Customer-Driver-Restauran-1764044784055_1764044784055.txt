SAFEGO MASTER RULES (ALWAYS APPLY)

1) Multi-role super-app:
   - Roles: Customer, Driver, Restaurant, Admin.
   - Services: Rides, Food Delivery, Parcel/Package.
   - Every change must keep all 4 roles working: no breaking changes.

2) Core data & collections:
   - Rides, Food Orders, Deliveries as first-class collections.
   - Payments, Payouts, Promotions, KYC, Support/Tickets are shared systems.
   - Never hard-code IDs or emails; always use existing relations and helpers.

3) Country & KYC rules:
   - USA & Bangladesh KYC flows already exist.
   - Never bypass KYC/verification checks.
   - Reuse existing helpers like getVerifiedDriverProfile() if relevant.

4) Admin panel rules:
   - Admin views are for monitoring & configuration only.
   - Do not change admin security or permissions.
   - Any new navigation must respect existing access control.

5) Commission & payout rules:
   - Do not change payouts, fees, or promo math in this task.
   - Earnings logic must remain exactly as is.

6) Security rules:
   - Use existing auth/guard middleware; do not create new insecure routes.
   - No leaking internal IDs or sensitive data in query strings if avoidable.
   - Validate all inputs and handle null/undefined responses safely.
   - Never break existing login, KYC, or document upload flows.

7) Status flows:
   - Do not change ride/order/delivery state machines.
   - Do not change ticket/support status flows.
   - This task is ONLY about navigation to the existing driver help center.

8) Onboarding & UX:
   - Keep current UX structure for the driver dashboard.
   - New UI must match existing design system (buttons, typography, colors).
   - Mobile and desktop views must both work (responsive design).

9) Implementation discipline:
   - Read replit.md and existing code before changing anything.
   - Make minimal, targeted changes.
   - No schema changes, no new migrations for this task.
   - Fix TypeScript/ESLint errors you introduce.
   - Add safe null/undefined checks instead of assuming data is always present.

10) Task completeness:
   - Implement from start to finish in ONE pass.
   - Include UI, routing, integration, and basic tests/checks.
   - Do not leave TODOs.
   - Do not ask the user questions; make reasonable, safe assumptions and complete the work.


====================================================
TASK D7-NAV: Add Driver Help Center link to driver sidebar
====================================================

Goal:
The Driver Support & Help Center system is already implemented (D7). Now I want a professional, Uber/Lyft-style navigation entry so drivers can easily open the Help Center from their main driver UI.

You must:
- Add a "Help Center" (or "Support") navigation link for drivers.
- Reuse the existing driver support/help routes and pages.
- Keep everything consistent with the current driver sidebar and design.
- Finish the implementation end-to-end in this task (no partial work).

Please follow these steps carefully.

--------------------------------
1) Understand current driver layout and support routes
--------------------------------
1. Open replit.md and any driver architecture documentation to understand:
   - Where the driver layout and sidebar are defined.
   - What the current route is for the driver Help Center / Support page.

2. In the client codebase, locate:
   - The main driver layout component (e.g. something like:
     - client/src/layouts/DriverLayout.tsx
     - or client/src/components/driver/DriverSidebar.tsx
     - or similar).
   - The existing driver Help/Support page component and route, for example:
     - /driver/support
     - /driver/help-center
     - /driver/help
     (Whatever is ALREADY configured. DO NOT create a new route if one already exists.)

3. Confirm how driver sidebar links are currently configured:
   - Some JSON/array of navigation items, or
   - Hard-coded list of <NavLink>/<Link> components.

4. Confirm which router is in use (Next.js pages/app router, React Router, or custom).

Do NOT change any route paths that are already in use. Only reuse them.

--------------------------------
2) Add driver Help Center navigation item (sidebar + optional header)
--------------------------------
Implement the following:

1. In the driver sidebar/navigation configuration:
   - Add a new navigation item:
     - Label: "Help Center"
     - Icon: Reuse an existing icon style (e.g., a question-mark, life-ring, or info icon) consistent with other sidebar items.
     - Route: Use the EXISTING driver help/support route you found earlier.
       Example route name (for illustration only):
         path: "/driver/support" 
       You must use the actual path from the codebase.

2. If there is a top-right profile or overflow menu in the driver UI:
   - Optionally add a secondary "Help Center" link there as well for better UX.
   - Do not remove anything that already exists.

3. Respect role-based access:
   - Ensure the Help Center link only appears for authenticated drivers.
   - Reuse the same auth guard / route protection used by other driver pages like:
     - /driver
     - /driver/vehicle
     - /driver/wallet
   - Do NOT expose this link in customer, restaurant, or admin sidebars.

4. Active state & styling:
   - When the driver is on the Help Center page, the sidebar item should show as active/highlighted, consistent with other routes.
   - Use existing classes/utility functions (e.g., isActiveRoute, NavLink activeClassName, or tailwind variants).
   - Check dark/light mode support if applicable and keep it consistent.

--------------------------------
3) Keep mobile and desktop UX professional
--------------------------------
1. If there is a mobile drawer / collapsed sidebar:
   - Ensure the "Help Center" item also appears in the mobile nav.
   - Test on the narrow viewport (Replit preview "mobile" mode) that:
     - The item is visible.
     - Tapping it navigates correctly to the Help Center page.
     - There are no layout overflows or line breaks.

2. Do NOT:
   - Introduce new horizontal scroll on the sidebar.
   - Change the order of existing core items in a way that confuses users.

Recommended order example (only if it matches existing logic):
   - Dashboard
   - Opportunities / Promotions
   - Earnings / Wallet
   - Vehicle
   - Documents / KYC
   - Help Center
   - Settings / Account

If there is an established order in the current code, respect that and insert "Help Center" in the most logical place (usually near Settings or Documents).

--------------------------------
4) Integration & security checks
--------------------------------
1. Make sure Help Center route still:
   - Uses the same auth checks as other driver routes.
   - Does NOT show admin-only data.
   - Does NOT leak any internal ticket IDs beyond what was already implemented.

2. Ensure you do NOT:
   - Touch database schema or migrations.
   - Modify ticket status flows or support logic.
   - Change any business rules around who can see which tickets.

3. If you need to fetch driver tickets or help content when navigating from the sidebar:
   - Reuse existing APIs/endpoints.
   - Add null/undefined checks on responses (e.g. if (!data) show a safe empty state).

--------------------------------
5) Testing (must be done before you finish)
--------------------------------
Run through this test plan manually:

1. Login as a driver user.
2. From the Driver Dashboard:
   - Confirm the sidebar shows a "Help Center" (or "Support") item.
   - Click it:
     - The Help Center / Support page should open.
     - No 404 or "page not found".
     - No console errors in the browser dev tools.

3. From another driver page (e.g., /driver/vehicle or /driver/promotions):
   - Click "Help Center" from the sidebar:
     - Navigation should work instantly.
     - Active state should move to the Help Center item.

4. Mobile view:
   - Open the driver app in mobile preview.
   - Open the nav drawer.
   - Tap "Help Center":
     - Page opens correctly.
     - Drawer closes as expected (if that is the current behavior for other items).

5. Regression checks:
   - Customer, Restaurant, and Admin sidebars must remain unchanged.
   - No new TypeScript or lint errors.
   - No failing build or runtime errors.

--------------------------------
6) Documentation
--------------------------------
1. Update replit.md (or the appropriate documentation file) with a short section:
   - Document that:
     - A driver "Help Center" navigation item exists in the driver sidebar.
     - Which route it uses (e.g. /driver/support or the actual path you used).
     - How it behaves on mobile vs desktop.
   - Note that no schema/database changes were made.

2. In your final message to the user, provide:
   - A short summary of what files you changed (layouts/components/routes).
   - A brief note that:
     - Driver sidebar and mobile drawer now include a Help Center link.
     - Navigation is role-safe and consistent with existing design.
     - No other roles (customer/restaurant/admin) were modified.

Make sure all of the above is fully implemented before you stop. Do NOT leave partial wiring or TODO comments.
