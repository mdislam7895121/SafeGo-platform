You are working on the SafeGo Driver Phase D1 (multi-vehicle + driver onboarding + KYC).

Current bug to fix (high priority):

Context:
- App: SafeGo Driver web app.
- Route: /driver/kyc-documents
- All KYC document uploads (insurance, inspection, license, plate, TLC) are working.
- Only the **Profile Photo** upload is failing.
- UI shows red toast: `Upload failed {"message":"Unexpected field"}` as soon as we try to upload the profile photo.
- Other driver uploads (for example driver profile photo in /driver/account/manage) are already working after your previous fixes.

What this means:
- The backend upload middleware (likely Multer) does not recognize the form field name used for the profile photo on /driver/kyc-documents.
- Either the frontend is sending a different field name than the backend expects, or the profile photo field is missing from the Multer `.single()` / `.array()` / `.fields()` configuration for that endpoint.

Your tasks:

1. Locate the exact API endpoint used by the KYC "Profile Photo" upload on `/driver/kyc-documents`.
   - Frontend file is probably `client/src/pages/driver/kyc-documents.tsx`.
   - Find the mutation or handler that is called when the user uploads the profile photo on this page.
   - Identify:
     - The request URL (POST path)
     - The HTTP method (POST)
     - The multipart field name used on the frontend (e.g. "profilePhoto", "file", "kycProfilePhoto", etc.).

2. Find the backend handler and upload middleware for this route.
   - Likely in `server/routes/driver.ts` or a KYC-specific route file.
   - Also inspect `server/middleware/upload.ts` or any shared upload middleware.
   - Identify which Multer configuration is applied to this endpoint and which field names it allows.

3. Fix the "Unexpected field" error by aligning the field names:
   - Make sure the **same field name** is used:
     - In the React/TSX form on `/driver/kyc-documents` for profile photo.
     - In the Multer configuration (single/array/fields) for the corresponding backend endpoint.
   - Preferred approach:
     - Reuse the same secure upload pipeline you already use for the **driver profile photo** on `/driver/account/manage`, but scoped here as a KYC profile photo upload if needed.
   - Ensure the profile photo upload for KYC respects:
     - Authenticated driver only (driver role, not restaurant).
     - Ownership checking (driver can only upload their own photo).
     - Same file size and type limits as other KYC image uploads (max 5MB, image mime types only).
     - Existing filename sanitization and safe storage path.

4. Do NOT break any existing behavior:
   - Restaurant uploads must keep working as-is.
   - Existing driver profile photo upload in `/driver/account/manage` must continue to work.
   - All other KYC document uploads on `/driver/kyc-documents` must continue to work.
   - Keep all SafeGo security rules:
     - No unauthenticated upload.
     - No path traversal.
     - Do not expose raw storage paths publicly. Use the same pattern you already implemented in D1-IMG.

5. Improve error handling for this endpoint:
   - Make sure the backend always returns a JSON object with either:
     - `{ success: true, ... }` on success, or
     - `{ success: false, message: "..." }` on failure.
   - In the frontend `/driver/kyc-documents.tsx`, update the mutation to:
     - Check for `response.ok` and for `json.success === true`.
     - Show a clear toast message on failure using the backend `message` if available, instead of crashing on `null` or malformed payloads.

6. Manual testing you MUST perform and confirm in your summary:
   - Start the dev server and open the driver app as a logged-in driver.
   - Go to `/driver/kyc-documents`.
   - Upload a valid profile photo (jpg/png, < 5MB).
   - Expected:
     - No more `{"message":"Unexpected field"}` toast.
     - A green success toast for profile photo upload.
     - After refresh, the uploaded photo should appear where the KYC profile photo is expected.
   - Verify that:
     - Other KYC documents on this page still upload correctly.
     - Driver profile photo upload on `/driver/account/manage` still works.
     - Restaurant image uploads are unaffected.

7. Documentation:
   - Update `replit.md` with a short "D1-KYC-PROFILE-PHOTO FIX" section:
     - Mention the correct endpoint.
     - The accepted multipart field name for the KYC profile photo.
     - Security validations applied.
     - Any known limitations deferred to later hardening phases.

8. Safety / Security reminders:
   - Do not weaken any RBAC/KYC checks.
   - Keep the SafeGo principles:
     - Driver must complete KYC steps before going online.
     - Admin can still review or revoke drivers without breaking uploads.

Finally, reply with:
- A short summary of what you changed.
- The final backend route signature and field name for the KYC profile photo upload.
- Confirmation that the error "Upload failed {\"message\":\"Unexpected field\"}" no longer appears when uploading a valid profile photo on `/driver/kyc-documents`.
