ROLE: You are the senior engineer owning SafeGo Admin Console stability.

========================
SAFEGO GLOBAL RULES (MUST FOLLOW)
========================
1) Roles & Surfaces
- Customer app, Driver app, Restaurant/Shop partner portal, Admin panel must be treated as separate UX surfaces.
- There are 4 roles you must always respect: customer, driver, restaurant/shop partner, admin.
- Never break existing role flows. No deletions of working features unless explicitly required.

2) Single Shared Backend Rule
- Pricing, commission, payout, ride status, country rules must come from the shared SafeGo backend via APIs.
- Do not create a second pricing/status engine inside any frontend.
- Frontend shows currency/region strictly from backend responses.

3) Country Logic
- USA: Ride, Food, Parcel.
- Bangladesh: Ride, Food, Parcel, Shop, Tickets.
- Country-specific features must be guarded by backend-driven config and role permissions.

4) Admin Panel Must-Haves
- Admin panel must include stable routing, sidebar navigation, page shells, proper auth guard, and zero “phantom routes.”
- All admin pages must render inside ONE admin layout and ONE router context.
- Every sidebar item and dashboard card must navigate to a real route (no 404, no duplicate dashboard).
- Add a clean AdminNotFound only as a last resort, never as the normal navigation outcome.

5) Security & Stability
- Protect admin routes behind admin auth (401/403 handled cleanly).
- No refactors that risk breaking stable work. Make incremental, non-breaking changes.
- Add a git checkpoint commit before and after the fix.

========================
TASK: INVESTIGATE + FIX ADMIN “DUPLICATE DASHBOARD / PAGE NOT FOUND”
========================
Context (from screenshots):
- Original Admin Dashboard renders fine.
- When clicking ANY dashboard card (or some sidebar items), a SECOND/duplicate admin area appears “below” and shows “Page Not Found” for routes like:
  /admin/cms-pages, /admin/onboarding-overview, /admin/activity-log, /admin/security-center, /admin/parcels...
- This indicates the admin UI is being mounted twice OR two route outlets exist, OR links trigger both navigation + a second render tree.

Goal:
- Remove the duplicate admin dashboard rendering entirely.
- Ensure all admin navigations resolve to the correct pages (no Page Not Found after clicking cards).
- Ensure sidebar scroll behavior is stable (menu should not jump/float strangely).

Deliverables (must do all):
A) Root-cause analysis (write it as a short bullet list in the PR description):
- Identify exactly where the second admin mount comes from.
- Identify whether it’s caused by:
  1) duplicate <AdminLayout>/<AdminApp> rendered twice,
  2) duplicate router providers (two Router contexts),
  3) nested routes/outlets that render a second “dashboard” section,
  4) wrong Link usage (anchor + router.push causing double navigation),
  5) conflicting frameworks (e.g., Next/Remix/App Router vs React Router) mixing patterns.

B) Code Fix (do the real fix, not a workaround):
1) ROUTING SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
- Ensure there is exactly ONE admin entry file that mounts the admin router/layout.
- Ensure admin pages are defined under one route tree: /admin/*.
- Remove/merge any duplicate admin route definitions or second admin “app shell.”
- Confirm there is only one <Outlet> (or equivalent) that renders admin page content.

2) FIX NAVIGATION COMPONENTS
- Dashboard cards: ensure they use ONE navigation method:
  - Use <Link to="..."> (React Router) OR router.push("...") (Next), not both.
  - If there is an <a href> plus onClick push, remove one and prevent default correctly.
- Sidebar items: ensure they navigate to existing routes.
- Confirm routes match exact paths (no mismatch like /admin/parcels?status=delivered mapped to /admin/parcels/status-delivered without route).

3) ADMIN NOT FOUND
- Keep AdminNotFound as fallback only.
- It must never appear for routes that exist.
- If routes were “invented” previously, either:
  - implement the missing pages as minimal shells (PageHeader + empty state), OR
  - remove the nav items/cards that point to non-existent routes.
  Choose the approach that preserves the product roadmap (prefer minimal shells so UI is complete).

4) SIDEBAR SCROLL / LAYOUT
- Sidebar should be fixed/sticky within the viewport and scroll independently if content exceeds height.
- Main content scroll should not drag sidebar off position.
- Implement CSS fixes:
  - stable height: 100vh / 100dvh
  - overflow-y: auto for sidebar area
  - prevent layout shifts on route change

C) Verification Checklist (must execute and report results)
- From /admin (dashboard):
  1) Click every dashboard card → navigates to the correct page, no duplicate dashboard appears.
  2) Click every sidebar item → correct page, no Page Not Found.
  3) Hard refresh on a deep route (example /admin/cms-pages) → still loads (auth permitting).
  4) Confirm only one admin shell is in the DOM (no second header/sidebar rendered).
- If 401/403 occurs due to not logged in, show a clean “Authentication required” state without breaking layout.

D) Git Hygiene
- Create a “before” checkpoint commit.
- Create an “after” commit with message:
  fix(admin): remove duplicate admin mount and stabilize routing
- If tags are used, add:
  admin-routing-stable

========================
HOW TO EXECUTE (MANDATORY WORKFLOW)
========================
1) Locate admin entry + routing:
- Search for: "AdminDashboard", "AdminLayout", "AdminApp", "admin routes", "<Outlet", "createBrowserRouter", "Routes", "Route", "router.push", "<Link", "href='/admin"
- Identify ALL files that define /admin routes. There must be only one final source.

2) Locate duplicate render:
- Search for AdminLayout/AdminShell being rendered in:
  - a layout file AND a page file at the same time
  - a top-level App shell and also inside a route component
- Remove the extra mount.

3) Fix nav elements:
- Dashboard cards: replace any mixed navigation with a single approach.
- Sidebar: ensure to paths match route definitions.

4) Add minimal page shells if needed:
- For any route in sidebar/cards that does not exist, create a minimal page component:
  - Title + description + “Coming soon” empty state
  - Do not crash, do not 404

OUTPUT FORMAT
========================
Return:
1) Root cause summary (bullets)
2) List of files changed (paths)
3) Key code snippets (only the critical ones)
4) Verification results checklist (pass/fail)
5) The two git commands to commit/tag

Do not ask me questions. Investigate in the codebase and fix it end-to-end.
