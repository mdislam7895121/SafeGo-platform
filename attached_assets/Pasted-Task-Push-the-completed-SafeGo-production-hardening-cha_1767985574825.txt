Task: Push the completed SafeGo production hardening changes to GitHub safely, with proof and a non-breaking deployment.

Rules:
- Do NOT remove/rename existing APIs, routes, or fields.
- Only additive/minimal changes already made (health endpoints, DB error handler, audit wrapper).
- No destructive Prisma actions (no reset, no drop).
- Keep existing repo structure.

1) PRE-PUSH CHECKS (must run and share outputs)
- Ensure working tree is clean and only intended files changed:
  git status
  git diff --stat

- Confirm no remaining direct audit log writes:
  grep -R "prisma\.auditLog\.create" -n server || true

- Confirm health endpoints exist:
  grep -R "api/health" -n server/routes server/index.ts server || true
  grep -R "api/health/db" -n server/routes server/index.ts server || true

2) COMMIT (single clean commit)
- Create a new branch:
  git checkout -b prod-hardening-railway

- Stage only intended files:
  git add server/utils/audit.ts
  git add server/index.ts server/app.ts server/middleware/* server/routes/*
  git add docs/RAILWAY_PRODUCTION_HARDENING.md
  (Adjust paths to match actual changes; do not add secrets)

- Commit message (exact):
  git commit -m "Prod hardening: audit-safe logging, DB error handling, health/db endpoint"

3) PUSH TO GITHUB
- Push branch:
  git push -u origin prod-hardening-railway

4) PR / MERGE
- Open a PR into main (or your production branch).
- Include in PR description:
  - What changed (audit wrapper, DB error handler, /api/health, /api/health/db)
  - Why non-breaking
  - How to verify (curl commands)
  - Env var notes (DISABLE_AUDIT toggle)

5) RAILWAY REDEPLOY (after merge)
- Redeploy from the merged commit.
- Provide proof:
  curl -i https://safego-platform-production.up.railway.app/api/health
  curl -i https://safego-platform-production.up.railway.app/api/health/db
  and a screenshot of Railway deployment logs showing server started + port.

Deliverables back to me:
- GitHub branch name + PR link
- Output of git diff --stat
- Output of grep auditLog command (should be empty)
- curl outputs (health + health/db)
- Screenshot of Railway deploy logs
