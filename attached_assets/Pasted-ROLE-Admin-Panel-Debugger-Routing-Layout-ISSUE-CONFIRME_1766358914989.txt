ROLE: Admin Panel Debugger (Routing + Layout)

ISSUE (CONFIRMED BY SCREENSHOT):
Inside /admin, a 404 overlay card is still rendering (“Did you forget to add the page to the router?”).
This means the admin routing/layout is STILL duplicated or a nested Router/Outlet is still mounted.

GOAL:
- Admin must have exactly ONE routing tree and ONE layout.
- No global NotFound component may render inside AdminLayout.
- Visiting /admin must never show any 404 overlay card.

MANDATORY TASKS (DO NOT SKIP):

1) FIND THE SOURCE OF THE 404 OVERLAY
- Search codebase for the exact text:
  "Did you forget to add the page to the router?"
  "404 Page Not Found"
- Identify which component renders it (file path + component name).
- This is the component that must not render inside Admin pages.

2) REMOVE NESTED ROUTER / DOUBLE OUTLET
- Audit AdminLayout/AdminShell/AdminApp:
  - Ensure there is only one <RouterProvider>/<BrowserRouter>/<Routes> (whatever framework used).
  - Ensure there is only one <Outlet/> (or equivalent) at admin root.
  - Ensure no admin page imports AdminLayout again.

3) FIX ADMIN ROUTE TREE
- Admin routes must be defined in one place.
- /admin should render Dashboard, not a NotFound fallback.
- /admin/cms-pages must resolve to CMS list page (no redirects masking issues).
- Remove any fallback route that matches too broadly inside admin.

4) STOP RENDERING GLOBAL NOTFOUND INSIDE ADMIN
- If there is a global NotFound route/component, it must only render at app root routing level,
  NOT inside admin layout.
- Admin should have its own AdminNotFound page, but it should only render when an admin path is invalid.

5) VERIFICATION (REQUIRED EVIDENCE)
Provide screenshots (or console logs) proving:
- /admin shows only one header + one sidebar
- No 404 overlay card appears anywhere in admin
- /admin/cms-pages loads (even if API fails, it must not 404)
- DOM/React tree confirms single AdminLayout mount (no nested layout)

DELIVERABLE FORMAT:
- “Cause” (exact file/component causing overlay)
- “Fix” (what you changed)
- “Proof” (routes tested and results)
