PROMPT A — SAFEGO US DRIVER ONBOARDING (NYC 5 BORO TLC ZONE, TLC RULES) — FULL IMPLEMENTATION A→Z

You are an expert full-stack engineer working on the SafeGo global super-app.  
Your job: implement and wire up the **US NYC 5-Borough (TLC zone) driver onboarding + vehicle onboarding + admin verification** flows, fully production-ready, WITHOUT breaking any existing SafeGo features.

=====================================================================
0. ABSOLUTE NON-BREAKING RULES (DO NOT VIOLATE)
=====================================================================
- SafeGo already has multiple modules live. YOU MUST NOT:
  - rename any existing fields
  - rename or delete any APIs
  - change existing routes/URLs
  - remove or repurpose any existing components
- All changes must be **additive**:
  - only ADD new fields, components, routes, feature flags, or config
  - if you must change behavior, do it behind clearly named feature flags
- If something is ambiguous, choose the safest, backward-compatible approach.

=====================================================================
1. GLOBAL SAFEGO MASTER RULES (ALWAYS ENFORCE)
=====================================================================
Always respect these system-wide rules when implementing anything.

1. ROLES (4 fixed roles)
   - customer
   - driver
   - restaurant (merchant)
   - admin
   Each role has its own:
   - signup or onboarding flow
   - KYC/verification rules
   - dashboard
   - permissions
   - status flows
   NEVER mix role access.

2. GLOBAL SERVICES (3 core)
   SafeGo must always support all three:
   - Ride-hailing
   - Food delivery
   - Parcel delivery
   This prompt focuses on **drivers in US/NYC**, but you MUST NOT break existing flows for food_orders and deliveries, and you must keep the data models ready to support all three services for the same driver.

3. COUNTRY-SPECIFIC KYC: BD vs US (ALWAYS INCLUDE)
   SafeGo supports at least:
   - Bangladesh (BD)
   - United States (US)

   3.1. BANGLADESH (BD) mandatory KYC fields (do NOT remove/change):
   - father_name
   - date_of_birth
   - present_address
   - permanent_address
   - NID_number
   - NID_front_image_url
   - NID_back_image_url
   - emergency_contact_name
   - emergency_contact_phone
   - verification_status (pending/approved/rejected)
   - is_verified (boolean)

   3.2. UNITED STATES (US) mandatory KYC fields (base)
   - date_of_birth
   - home_address
   - emergency_contact_name
   - emergency_contact_phone
   - government_id_type (e.g. "state_id", "passport", "driver_license")
   - government_id_last4
   - verification_status
   - is_verified

   3.3. Extra for US DRIVERS (global rule, do not remove):
   - driver_license_number
   - driver_license_state
   - driver_license_expiry
   - driver_license_image_url
   - ssn_last4 (optional but supported)
   - for NYC TLC zone: tlc_license_number, tlc_license_image_urls, tlc_license_expiry

   You MUST keep BD and US KYC completely separate, via `country` and conditional schemas/validation.

4. ADMIN PANEL (MANDATORY CAPABILITIES)
   Admin must be able to:
   - verify customers
   - verify drivers
   - verify restaurants
   - approve/reject KYC
   - see `rejection_reason`
   - update pricing, fees, commissions
   - block/unblock any user
   - manage payouts
   - view driver negative balance
   -
