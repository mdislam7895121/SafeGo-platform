The Partner Onboarding Center is not complete. Please finish the full onboarding system exactly as specified below. This must match all four partner types and include country-aware logic.

Complete these four onboarding flows with full database integration:

1. DRIVER / COURIER ONBOARDING (Bangladesh + USA)
Fields: full_name, phone, email, city, service_type (ride/delivery), vehicle_type, country
Save under: admin.driversOnboarding
Statuses: New → In Review → Approved → Rejected

2. RESTAURANT ONBOARDING (Bangladesh only)
Fields: restaurant_name, owner_name, phone, email, city, cuisine, country=Bangladesh
Save under: admin.restaurantsOnboarding
Statuses: New → In Review → Approved → Rejected

3. SHOP ONBOARDING (Bangladesh only)
Fields: shop_name, owner_name, phone, category, city, country=Bangladesh
Save under: admin.shopsOnboarding
Statuses: New → In Review → Approved → Rejected

4. TICKET PARTNER ONBOARDING (Bangladesh only)
Fields: business_name, contact_person, phone, ticket_type, city, country=Bangladesh
Save under: admin.ticketsOnboarding
Statuses: New → In Review → Approved → Rejected

REQUIREMENTS:
– Create separate frontend pages for each onboarding type
– Show only Bangladesh-specific forms when the landing page region is Bangladesh
– Show only driver onboarding when region is USA
– Save each form into its respective admin database table
– Create 4 separate admin panels:
    • /admin/onboarding/drivers
    • /admin/onboarding/restaurants
    • /admin/onboarding/shops
    • /admin/onboarding/tickets
– Each admin page must support:
    • Status update buttons
    • Notes field
    • Filters: Country, City, Status
    • Search by name or phone

SECURITY:
– Validate all inputs
– Add rate limiting to all onboarding endpoints
– Add logging for onboarding submissions

After finishing, test all four flows, and show me screenshots from all four admin onboarding lists. 
Make sure everything works region-wise (Bangladesh vs USA).
