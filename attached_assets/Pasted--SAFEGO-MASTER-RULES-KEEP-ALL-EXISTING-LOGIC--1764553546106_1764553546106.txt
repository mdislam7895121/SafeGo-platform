SAFEGO MASTER RULES (KEEP ALL EXISTING LOGIC)
===========================================
Do NOT modify or remove: 4 roles, BD/US KYC rules, onboarding, admin approvals,
commissions, payouts, security rules, collections (rides, food_orders, deliveries),
status flows, wallet logic, blocking logic, or matching engine.

Everything must remain backward-compatible.

TASK: MAKE FOOTER “GO ONLINE / GO OFFLINE” BUTTON FULLY ACTIVE
==========================================================

1) Create a single toggle button in the footer:
   - When driver is OFFLINE, show:
       - Label: “Go Online”
       - Color: GREEN (#28C840)
       - Icon: power symbol, green
   - When driver taps it:
       - Validate driver status:
           • is_verified must be true
           • not blocked
           • vehicle assigned
           • no active trip
       - If valid → set driver_status = "online"
       - Update UI to ONLINE mode

   - When driver is ONLINE, show:
       - Label: “Go Offline”
       - Color: RED (#FF3B30)
       - Icon: power symbol, red
   - When tapped in ONLINE mode:
       - If no active ride/food/delivery:
            → set driver_status = "offline"
       - If active trip exists → prevent offline

2) Frontend requirements:
   - The button must be a pill-shaped component in the footer.
   - The background color must switch dynamically:
       • offline → green
       • online → red
   - Label text must switch instantly without reload.
   - Must use a single component (not two separate buttons).
   - Must persist state from backend: if page reloads, read driver_status.

3) Backend requirements:
   - Store driver_status in driver record:
       • "offline"
       • "online"
   - Changing this status must not break ride/food/parcel matchmaking.
   - Must be used by ride-matching engine:
       • only drivers with driver_status="online" can receive requests

4) Notifications:
   - When going online → show toast: “You are now online”
   - When going offline → show toast: “You are now offline”

5) Security:
   - Drivers cannot force online if verification_status != "approved".
   - Admin block must override toggle.
   - Keep all existing SafeGo access controls intact.

6) UI cleanup (if not already applied):
   - Ensure no other Go Online/Offline button exists on screen.
   - Footer toggle is the ONLY online/offline control.

==========================================================
Perform all changes above without modifying any unrelated UI.
