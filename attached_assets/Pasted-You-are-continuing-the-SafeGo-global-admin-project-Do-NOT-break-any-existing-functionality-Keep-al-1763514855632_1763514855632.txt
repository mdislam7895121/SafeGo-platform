You are continuing the SafeGo global admin project. Do NOT break any existing functionality. Keep all changes incremental and safe.

Goal: Finish the Admin Customer Management features so that the global admin can see all customers, open a customer list, and view customer details, similar to the existing Driver Management section.

Scope: ONLY work on customer-related admin features. Do not touch ride-matching logic, driver flows, restaurant flows, authentication, or KYC logic.

Requirements:

1) Backend – Admin Customer APIs
- Review existing Prisma models: User, CustomerProfile, Ride, FoodOrder, Delivery, Complaints (or similar).
- Confirm if admin endpoints already exist. If not, create admin-only endpoints such as:
  - GET /api/admin/customers
    - Returns paginated list of customers
    - Supports filters: country, verificationStatus (pending, verified, blocked), search by email
  - GET /api/admin/customers/:customerId
    - Returns single customer with:
      - Basic profile: email, country, verificationStatus, createdAt, lastLogin (if stored)
      - Aggregated stats: totalRides, totalFoodOrders, totalDeliveries
      - Recent 5–10 rides/orders/deliveries with status and timestamps
      - Complaint summary if complaints model exists
- Reuse existing block/unblock logic:
  - If there is already an admin block/unblock endpoint for users, make sure it works for customers too.
- Enforce security:
  - All these endpoints must be admin-only, protected by existing auth middleware and role checks.
  - Never return sensitive fields: passwordHash, JWT secrets, full NID/SSN, or any secret tokens.
  - If ID documents are stored, return at most a masked version (e.g., last 4 digits).

2) Frontend – Admin Navigation & Pages
- In the Admin Dashboard UI, add customer management similar to driver management:
  - In the “Platform Overview” or stats section, add customer-related cards:
    - Total Customers
    - Verified Customers
    - Blocked Customers
  - Make these cards clickable and navigate to the customer list page.

- Management section:
  - Add a “Customer Management” card next to Driver Management and Complaints:
    - Title: “Customer Management”
    - Subtitle: “View, block, and manage all customers”
    - On click, navigate to /admin/customers

- Customer list page:
  - Use the file already created: client/src/pages/admin/customers.tsx
  - Implement a table with:
    - Columns: Email, Country, Verification Status, Total Rides, Total Food Orders, Total Deliveries, Created At, Actions
    - Pagination controls (page, page size)
    - Filters:
      - Country dropdown (All, Bangladesh, United States, etc.)
      - Verification status filter (All, Pending, Verified, Blocked)
    - Search box for email
    - “View” button in each row that opens the details page.
  - Use TanStack Query for data fetching with:
    - proper query keys
    - automatic refetch when filters/search/pagination change
    - error and loading states.

- Customer details page:
  - Use the file already created: client/src/pages/admin/customer-details.tsx
  - Show:
    - Basic profile info (email, country, createdAt, verificationStatus)
    - Stats: total rides, total food orders, total deliveries
    - Recent activity:
      - last 5 rides
      - last 5 food orders
      - last 5 parcel deliveries
    - Complaint history if available.
  - Admin actions:
    - Block / Unblock customer (reuse existing admin block endpoint)
    - Optional: “Reset login access” placeholder button that just shows a toast saying “Feature coming soon” (do not implement password reset logic now).
  - Add back navigation to go to the customer list.

3) Dashboard integration & UX
- Ensure all dashboard number cards (Total Users, Total Drivers, etc.) remain correct.
- Add customer counts into the existing stats calculations, but keep logic simple and efficient (avoid heavy queries on every refresh).
- All admin list and details pages (drivers, customers, complaints) must:
  - Use consistent layout
  - Have automatic refetch (e.g., every 10–15 seconds) to simulate live data, but keep intervals reasonable.

4) Security phase for this change (SafeGo Security Roadmap – Phase 2: Admin & Data Access Hardening)
- Confirm that:
  - New routes are wrapped in admin-only ProtectedRoute on the frontend.
  - Backend verifies the admin role before serving any customer data.
  - Responses exclude sensitive fields and large payloads (use pagination and field selection).
  - Add minimal logging for admin actions: blocking/unblocking customers.

5) Testing
- Create or use demo customers from both BD and US.
- Approve KYC so they become “verified.”
- Place a few demo rides/food orders/deliveries for them.
- Verify:
  - Dashboard shows correct total and verified customer counts.
  - Clicking the customer cards navigates to /admin/customers.
  - Customer list shows correct filters, search, and pagination.
  - Customer details page loads with correct recent activity.
  - Block/Unblock works and is reflected in both the list and details page without breaking the customer app.
- Do NOT change any existing driver, restaurant, or wallet logic.

Finally, summarize all code changes (files touched) and confirm that the Admin Customer Management system is fully working and production-ready without breaking existing features.
