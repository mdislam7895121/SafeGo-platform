Improve the Call To Action (CTA) section to achieve a premium Uber-level UI polish without changing any text, routing, logic, or backend.

Enhance ONLY the visuals and spacing. Keep HTML structure and component boundaries the same.

### REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS

1) Background
- Keep the current gradient (#0054F5 → #0131A0) but add:
  - A subtle highlight layer: linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(255,255,255,0.05), transparent).
  - Slight vignette: inset shadow around edges to give depth.

2) Title & Subtitle
- Increase vertical spacing consistency:
  - Title bottom margin: ~14–16px
  - Subtitle bottom margin: ~40px

3) App Store + Google Play badges
- Upgrade to premium-style badges:
  - Background: #000 with 98% opacity (rich black)
  - Outer shadow: 0 10px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.38)
  - Inner subtle gloss: inset 0 1px 0 rgba(255,255,255,0.1)
  - Rounded corners: 14–16px
  - On hover:
    - Lift: transform translateY(-3px)
    - Increase brightness: filter brightness(1.1)

4) Improve badge alignment
- Ensure badges are vertically centered
- Set exact horizontal gap: 28px desktop, 16px tablet, wrap on mobile
- Make badge icons slightly larger (5–8%)

5) Improve the Become a Partner button
- Style:
  - Full-pill shape with radius ~40px
  - Background: white
  - Text color: brand blue #0054F5
  - Shadow: 0 6px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.25)
- Hover:
  - transform: translateY(-2px)
  - shadow: stronger 0 8px 22px rgba(0,0,0,0.28)
- Active click:
  - transform: translateY(0)

6) Max-width and centering
- Wrap everything inside a centered container with:
  - max-width: 900–1040px
  - padding-left/right: 24px on mobile, 32px tablet

7) Responsiveness
- Mobile:
  - Reduce title font slightly
  - Badges stack vertically with equal spacing
- Tablet:
  - Badges in 1 row but closer together
- Desktop:
  - Maintain perfect center alignment

8) Accessibility
- Ensure badges keep aria-labels
- Maintain keyboard focus ring: white outline 2px

### IMPORTANT
- Do not modify any backend API, routing, or config.
- Do not touch footer or any other sections.
- Only polish this specific CTA component visually.

After finishing:
- Render a desktop screenshot of the updated CTA.
- Summarize all improvements.
