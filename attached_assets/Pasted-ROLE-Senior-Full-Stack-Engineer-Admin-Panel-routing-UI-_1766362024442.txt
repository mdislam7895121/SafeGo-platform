ROLE: Senior Full-Stack Engineer (Admin Panel routing + UI)

TASK: Fix ONLY the Admin Finance section 404 issue.
Symptoms:
- Navigating to these URLs returns 404 Page Not Found:
  1) /admin/finance/overview
  2) /admin/finance/gateway-reports
- Finance sidebar items are broken because routes are missing or miswired.

STRICT SCOPE:
- Do NOT touch other modules (rides, users, parcels, etc.).
- Do NOT refactor the whole admin.
- Do NOT create “duplicate admin dashboards”.
- Only fix Finance routes and the navigation to Finance pages.

WHAT TO DO (Step-by-step):
1) Identify the admin router system used in this project (React Router / Next.js / file-based routing / custom route table).
2) Locate the source of truth for admin routes and sidebar links (examples: src/routes/adminRoutes.ts, adminRouter.tsx, pages/admin/**, app/admin/**, routes.ts, etc.).
3) Search for existing Finance pages/components already in codebase:
   - Look for files or components containing: "Finance", "gateway-reports", "payout", "wallet", "revenue", "transactions".
   - If Finance page components exist but routes are missing, REGISTER them properly.
4) Ensure these exact routes are implemented and render a real page (not fallback):
   - /admin/finance/overview  -> FinanceOverview page
   - /admin/finance/gateway-reports -> GatewayReports page
5) Fix sidebar navigation targets so they match the registered routes exactly.
   - No relative path mistakes, no duplicated base path, no wrong nesting.
6) Confirm there is only ONE admin router/layout wrapper handling navigation.
   - If Finance links are being handled by a different/duplicate router causing fallback, remove/disable that duplicate handling ONLY for Finance navigation (do not change global admin behavior).
7) Add a minimal safe fallback:
   - If a Finance page is not implemented yet, show a placeholder page with title + “Coming soon” instead of 404.
   - But still keep the route valid.

ACCEPTANCE TESTS:
- Visiting /admin/finance/overview loads a Finance Overview screen (even if basic).
- Visiting /admin/finance/gateway-reports loads a Gateway Reports screen (even if basic).
- Clicking Finance items from the sidebar lands on these pages with no 404.
- No new duplicate admin dashboards appear.

DELIVERABLES:
- List the exact files changed.
- Show the route table / router diff.
- Provide proof via screenshots or console logs showing the two URLs render successfully.

IMPORTANT:
- Keep changes minimal and non-breaking.
- Do not touch authentication logic.
- Do not change unrelated admin routes.
