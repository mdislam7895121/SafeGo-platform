Step 10 — Implement NYC TLC Tolls Detection and Billing System

Proceed with Step 10 of the NYC TLC regulatory workflow. Add the official tolls system with the following specifications:

1. Toll Detection Rules:
   - Detect toll crossings using polygon-based or waypoint-based detection.
   - Supported toll facilities:
       • Verrazzano Bridge
       • Hugh L. Carey Tunnel (Battery Tunnel)
       • Queens-Midtown Tunnel
       • RFK/Triborough Bridge
       • Whitestone Bridge
       • Throgs Neck Bridge
       • George Washington Bridge
       • Goethals Bridge
       • Bayonne Bridge
       • Outerbridge Crossing
       • Lincoln Tunnel
       • Holland Tunnel
   - Detect direction: inbound/outbound pricing where applicable.

2. Toll Pricing:
   - Use published EZ-Pass rates (standard TLC requirement).
   - If API toll data exists, prioritize API.
   - If toll = unknown → default to NYC TLC standard toll table.

3. Commission Rules:
   - Tolls are a full pass-through → NOT commissionable.
   - NOT included in discounts or promo reductions.
   - NOT part of minimum fare calculations.

4. Fare Pipeline Position:
   Insert AFTER:
       • Out-of-Town Return Fee (Step 6H)
   BEFORE:
       • Service Fee
       • Commission
       • Driver Payout

5. API Response Fields:
   - tolls: array of detected toll objects
   - totalTolls: numeric
   - tollsApplied: boolean

6. UI Requirements:
   - FareBreakdown UI must show each toll separately:
       • Name
       • Amount
       • Direction (if applicable)
   - Show “Tolls” section when any toll applies.

7. Test Coverage:
   Add 40+ test cases covering:
       • NYC → NJ via Holland Tunnel (apply correct toll)
       • NJ → NYC via Lincoln Tunnel (apply correct toll)
       • Queens → Manhattan via Midtown Tunnel
       • Bronx → Queens via Whitestone
       • Staten Island → Brooklyn via Verrazzano
       • No tolls for within-borough routes
       • Combined toll + airport fee + congestion fee
       • Promo active → toll stays unchanged
       • Out-of-town + toll combinations
       • Sequence: tolls must appear before service fee/commission
       • Tolls excluded from commission and payout math

8. Documentation:
   - Add a complete “NYC TLC Toll Rules” section to replit.md.
   - Include a full table of bridges/tunnels and their default rates.
   - Include examples of correct billing and sequences.

Complete Step 10 and verify before we proceed to Step 11 (Final TLC Reconciliation Reports).
