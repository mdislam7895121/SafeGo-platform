Task: Unify the customer ride-request UI into a single device-friendly design that works identically on all devices (desktop, laptop, tablet, mobile). The layout may reflow responsively, but the UX and components must be the same everywhere.

Global SafeGo rules:
- Do NOT change backend logic: pricing, promos, commission, driver earnings, routing, dispatch, KYC, payments.
- Only update the customer web UI layout, styling, and responsive behavior.
- Re-use existing components (address inputs, ride cards, map, route selector, Request ride button).

1. One unified screen for all devices
- There must be ONE main ride-request screen (e.g., `/customer/ride-request`) used for all devices.
- Remove any separate mobile "Good night, islam789 / See prices" step. No separate mobile wizard.
- The flow must be:
    1) User opens the ride screen.
    2) User enters pickup & dropoff in the same address capsule panel.
    3) Ride cards update with prices.
    4) User chooses a ride.
    5) User chooses a route.
    6) User taps Request ride.
- Same screen, same components, everywhere. Only layout changes with breakpoints.

2. Address panel design (single capsule block)
- At the TOP of the page, under the SafeGo header, show a single “Plan your ride” address panel.
- Inside this panel:
    - Line 1: bold label "Plan your ride".
    - Line 2: a capsule for PICKUP:
        - Left: blue dot.
        - Text: pickup address (single line, ellipsis if long).
        - Right side: 
            - swap icon (⇅) to swap pickup/dropoff.
            - edit icon (✎ or similar) to open address input.
    - Line 3: a capsule for DROPOFF:
        - Left: red dot.
        - Text: dropoff address (single line, ellipsis).
        - Right side: edit icon.
- Add a small arrow icon at the far right of the whole panel:
    - When arrow is tapped:
        - Collapse/expand the panel (slide up/down) but NEVER destroy the state.
    - Default behavior:
        - On mobile: expanded when the page first loads.
        - On desktop: expanded as well.
- The address panel appears ONLY here. It must not reappear as a second or third block anywhere else (no duplicate address bars).

3. Map behavior (always visible, no 2-second floating overlay)
- The map should always be visible on the ride-request screen.
- Remove the temporary 2-second “floating card over map” view when prices load.
- Behavior:
    - When user changes pickup or dropoff:
        - Show a small loading indicator (spinner or “Updating prices…” message).
        - Update route and prices.
        - Keep the main layout stable (no full-screen transition).
- Map should:
    - Always show the route from pickup (A) to dropoff (B).
    - Center/zoom so both A and B are visible.
    - When the user chooses a different route, update the highlighted path.

4. Layout structure (same components, responsive layout)

4.1 Desktop / large screens (>= 1024px)
- Main layout: 2-column with sticky bottom button
    - Left column:
        - Address panel (from step 2).
        - SafeGo Everyday Saver banner (if promo active).
        - “Choose your ride” section:
            - All SafeGo ride cards in a vertical list:
              SafeGo X, SafeGo Comfort, SafeGo Comfort XL, SafeGo XL, SafeGo Black, SafeGo Black SUV, SafeGo WAV.
    - Right column:
        - Map (full height of the column).
        - Under the map: route selector buttons.
- Route selector:
    - 3 pill buttons in a row:
        - Fastest
        - Route 2
        - Route 3
    - All three must be fully visible (no cropping on the right).
    - Equal width: use flex with `space-between` or `gap` and fixed min-width.
- Request ride button:
    - Full width, pinned at the bottom of the screen (sticky footer).
    - Same look on all devices.

4.2 Mobile / small screens (< 1024px)
- Use the SAME components as desktop (no separate pages), just stack them vertically:
    1) Address panel (expandable capsule).
    2) SafeGo Everyday Saver banner.
    3) “Choose your ride” list (SafeGo cards, one per row).
    4) Map section (below the ride list, above the button).
    5) Route selector directly above the Request ride button:
        - 3 pill buttons in a horizontal scroll OR equal-width buttons that fit inside the screen. None of them should be clipped.
    6) Request ride button pinned at the bottom.
- When the user scrolls down, the address panel can collapse to save space:
    - Collapsed state: show only pickup and dropoff in a single thin bar with the arrow icon.
    - Tap arrow → expand the full panel again.

5. Route selector and current-location zoom
- When the user taps “Choose your route” or any route pill:
    - Map zooms so the customer’s current location and the full route are clearly visible.
    - On mobile, the map fills the middle of the screen between the ride list and the Request ride button (no part of the route buttons hidden).
- Keep the text underneath:
    - “Choose your favorite route on the map” on a single line.
    - “Back to ride details” as a secondary link aligned to the right.

6. Fix the 3 route buttons cropping issue
- Adjust CSS so that on narrow devices:
    - All three route pills are visible at once OR horizontally scrollable.
    - No button is partially cut off at the right side.
- Suggested implementation:
    - Use `display: flex; justify-content: space-between; gap: 8px;`
    - Each button with `flex: 1 1 0; text-align: center; white-space: nowrap;`.

7. Device-friendly rule (very important)
- Do NOT create different flows for desktop vs mobile.
- The SAME React components / views must be used for all devices.
- Only the layout (flex direction, stacking, widths, font sizes) may change by media queries / breakpoints.
- There must never be:
    - A special “Good night, islam789 / See prices” only on mobile.
    - A different home screen only for desktop.
- One screen, one flow, multiple responsive layouts.

8. Safety & verification
- Verify:
    - Address panel appears once and works the same on all devices.
    - Map always visible on the ride screen, no 2-second overlay screen.
    - When user edits address, prices and routes update but the page does not jump or change structure.
    - The three route buttons and the Request ride button are always fully visible.
- Do not touch any backend APIs, pricing formulas, promo calculation, or commission logic – UI only.

After implementing, please summarize:
- Which components/files you changed.
- How the unified layout behaves at ~375px width (mobile) and at ~1440px width (desktop).
