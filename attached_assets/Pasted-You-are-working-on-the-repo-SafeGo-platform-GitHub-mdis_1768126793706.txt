You are working on the repo: SafeGo-platform (GitHub: mdislam7895121/SafeGo-platform).

Goal:
Fix the Railway build + healthcheck failures and push a clean working commit to GitHub.

Current symptoms (from logs/screenshots):
1) Build fails with "spawn vite ENOENT" and sometimes "Cannot find package 'vite' imported from dist/index.js".
2) Running build shows "NODE_ENV=production vite build" and PowerShell on Windows says 'NODE_ENV' is not recognized (so scripts are not cross-platform).
3) Deploy healthcheck fails on /healthz because server never becomes healthy.
4) There were errors like "Cannot find package 'uuid' imported from dist/index.js" earlier, so runtime deps must be correct.

What you must do (A to Z, no questions):
1) Open package.json and fix scripts to be cross-platform (Linux/Railway). Use cross-env instead of NODE_ENV=production inline.
   - Add devDependency: cross-env
   - Update scripts:
     - "build": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production vite build"
     - "start": "node dist/index.js"
     - If "dev" exists keep it, but don’t break.
2) Ensure Vite exists in devDependencies and is installed during Railway build.
3) Ensure uuid is in dependencies (NOT devDependencies) because dist/index.js imports it at runtime.
4) Ensure dist is produced by build and NOT required at runtime unless built.
5) Ensure Express server binds to Railway port:
   - Use const port = Number(process.env.PORT || 5000)
   - Listen on 0.0.0.0
6) Implement a lightweight /healthz route that returns 200 immediately and is registered BEFORE heavy init.
7) Add Railway-friendly start:
   - Railway should run: npm run start (after build)
   - If railway.toml exists, ensure it uses:
     - buildCommand = "npm install && npm run build"
     - startCommand = "npm run start"
8) Clean up repo:
   - Remove any *.bak files and junk backups from git tracking.
   - Add/confirm .gitignore entries for *.bak and dist if needed (dist can be ignored; Railway builds it).
9) Run in Replit shell:
   - rm -rf node_modules dist package-lock.json
   - npm install
   - npm run build
   - npm run start
   - curl http://localhost:$PORT/healthz (or default 5000) returns 200
10) Commit with a clear message and push to GitHub main.

Output required:
- Tell me exactly which files you changed and what.
- Paste the final successful build and start logs (key lines only).
- Confirm the exact GitHub commit hash after push.
