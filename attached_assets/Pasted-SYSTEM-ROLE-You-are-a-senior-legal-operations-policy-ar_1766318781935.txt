==================================================
TASK TITLE
==================================================
SAFEGO GLOBAL – COMPLETE POLICY PACK (PILOT + SCALE READY)

==================================================
CONTEXT
==================================================

SafeGo Global:
- Services: Ride-hailing (ACTIVE), Food/Parcel/Shop/Ticket (COMING SOON)
- Countries: Bangladesh (BD) and United States (US)
- Current phase: Dhaka web-first pilot
- Payment model: Cash-based for pilot
- Admin-controlled verification & enforcement
- Drivers collect cash, SafeGo collects commission weekly
- Native apps and notifications are NOT live yet

==================================================
OBJECTIVE
==================================================

Create a COMPLETE, STRUCTURED POLICY SET that:

1) Is legally reasonable for a pilot launch
2) Protects the platform owner (SafeGo)
3) Is understandable by drivers, customers, and partners
4) Is scalable later without rewriting everything

DO NOT over-engineer.
DO NOT include investor-only or enterprise-only language.
DO NOT require external legal approvals.

==================================================
MANDATORY POLICIES TO CREATE
==================================================

You MUST create ALL of the following:

1) Privacy Policy (BD-first, US-compatible)
2) Terms of Service (Customer)
3) Driver Terms & Agreement
4) Restaurant / Merchant Terms (for future use)
5) Parcel Sender Terms (future use)
6) Ticketing Terms (future use)
7) Payment & Cash Handling Policy
8) Refund & Cancellation Policy
9) Driver Blocking & Suspension Policy
10) KYC & Verification Policy (BD + US)
11) Data Retention & Access Policy
12) Dispute Resolution Policy
13) Fraud & Abuse Policy
14) Safety & Emergency Policy
15) Platform Usage Rules & Prohibited Activities
16) Coming Soon Services Disclaimer Policy

==================================================
COUNTRY-SPECIFIC RULES (MANDATORY)

- NID handling
- Cash payment dominance
- Weekly settlement model
- Admin enforcement rights

For UNITED STATES (US), explicitly include:
- Government ID reference
- Online payment future readiness
- Driver license requirement

==================================================
STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS
==================================================

For EACH policy:
- Clear title
- Purpose
- Scope (who it applies to)
- Key rules (bullet points)
- Enforcement / consequences
- Pilot note (if applicable)

Language must be:
- Simple English
- Non-legalistic
- Clear and enforceable

==================================================
OUTPUT FORMAT
==================================================

- One combined document
- Clearly separated sections
- Ready to publish on website
- Headings and subheadings only (no markdown code blocks)

==================================================
IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS
==================================================

- Respect SafeGo role separation (Customer, Driver, Restaurant, Admin)
- Assume admin has final authority
- Assume services may be disabled during pilot
- Assume features may be unavailable without notice

==================================================
FINAL CHECK
==================================================

At the end, include a SUMMARY TABLE:
- Policy name
- Status (Pilot-ready / Future-ready)
- Who it applies to

If ANY required policy is missing, you must regenerate the output.
