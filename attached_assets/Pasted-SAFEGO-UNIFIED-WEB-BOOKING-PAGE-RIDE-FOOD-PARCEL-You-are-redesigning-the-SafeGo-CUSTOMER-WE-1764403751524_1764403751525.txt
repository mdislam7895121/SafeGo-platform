SAFEGO – UNIFIED WEB BOOKING PAGE (RIDE + FOOD + PARCEL)

You are redesigning the SafeGo CUSTOMER WEB BOOKING page for three services:
1) Ride Service
2) Food Delivery Service
3) Parcel Delivery Service

This is a corporate web experience (NOT a mobile app clone, NOT Uber app behavior).

====================================================
GLOBAL RULES
====================================================
- Do NOT modify backend business logic:
  - No changes to pricing engine, commissions, payouts, driver earnings, restaurant earnings, or routing APIs.
- Do NOT touch driver, restaurant, or admin portals.
- ONLY change:
  - Customer web UI layout
  - Styling (CSS)
  - Component composition and responsiveness
- There must be ONE unified layout for all devices (desktop-first, responsive).
- Do NOT create separate flows for mobile vs desktop. Same components, same steps, only layout changes.

====================================================
1. PAGE STRUCTURE
====================================================
The main SafeGo booking page must have this structure:

A) TOP NAV BAR
   - Left: SafeGo logo
   - Center/right: links like “Home, About, Services, Help”
   - Right: Login/Profile, language selector, support icon

B) SERVICE SWITCHER (3-SERVICE SELECTOR)
   - Below the nav bar, show a horizontal selector with 3 options:
     1) SafeGo Ride
     2) SafeGo Eats
     3) SafeGo Parcel
   - Each option is a clickable card/tab with:
     - Icon
     - Title
     - Short subtitle:
       • Ride – “Point-to-point rides”
       • Eats – “Order from nearby restaurants”
       • Parcel – “Send packages and documents”
   - Exactly ONE is active at a time.
   - Active state:
     - SafeGo Blue border and background tint
     - Bold title
   - Switching service does NOT change page, only the left panel content and right panel context.

C) MAIN CONTENT AREA (TWO PANELS)
   - A two-column layout:
     - LEFT PANEL: Service-specific booking form
     - RIGHT PANEL: Map / context panel
   - On desktop (≥ 1024px):
     - Left panel width ~40%
     - Right panel width ~60%
   - On smaller devices:
     - Left panel stacks on top
     - Right panel (map) stacks below
     - Same elements, same order.

====================================================
2. SERVICE-SPECIFIC PANELS (LEFT SIDE)
====================================================

Implement a React-style service state, e.g. `activeService = "ride" | "food" | "parcel"` and render different form content based on that.

====================================================
3. RIGHT PANEL – CONTEXT AREA (MAP / INFO)
====================================================

Right panel must dynamically adapt based on active service:

1) For Ride:
   - Show a map with route from pickup to dropoff.
   - Fit both points with padding.
   - Update route when user changes route selection.

2) For Food:
   - Show a map with:
     - Delivery address
     - Restaurant locations in the search radius
   - Optional cluster markers for restaurants.

3) For Parcel:
   - Show the route from sender to receiver.
   - Clearly indicate pickup and dropoff markers.

Common rules:
- Map must NEVER be hidden by overlays.
- No 2-second floating card overlays.
- Map always responds to form changes (address updates, selection changes).

====================================================
4. RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR
====================================================

For desktop (>= 1024px):
- Show two-column layout:
  - Left: form + list
  - Right: map
- Scrollable left panel, sticky map on the right.

For mobile/tablet:
- Stack vertically:
  - Top: Service switcher
  - Then: Left panel contents (form + list + buttons)
  - Bottom: Map (full width)
- Same components, same order.
- No separate mobile-specific screens, no bottom sheets, no full-screen overlays.

====================================================
5. CLEANUP & ALIGNMENT
====================================================

- Remove ANY extra, duplicated address sections from older ride-only implementations.
- Only ONE address section per service panel.
- Fix:
  - Route buttons so they are never cut off.
  - Request buttons so they never overlap other content.
  - All text must remain readable without overflow.
- Spacing:
  - 16px horizontal padding for panels
  - 24px vertical gaps between sections
  - 8–12px gaps between inline elements

====================================================
6. DELIVERABLE
====================================================

End result must be:
- One unified SafeGo web booking page
- Three services: Ride, Eats, Parcel
- Corporate, clean, desktop-first but responsive
- No app-like sliding behavior
- No duplication of flows
- Map + form working together for each service

After implementing, list:
- Components added/modified
- How activeService switcher controls left + right panels
- Any shared hooks or state containers you used.
