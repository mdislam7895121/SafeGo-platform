TASK:
Enhance the admin dashboard card glow further. Current glow is too soft and barely noticeable. Increase clarity, edge-light visibility, and add a more realistic floating effect without making the UI look neon or over-bright.

GOAL:
A very thin rim-light around the card + a soft natural light base underneath the card, so it feels gently elevated like premium iOS surfaces.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Edge Rim-Light (Highly Visible but Subtle)
   Apply this filter:
     filter: drop-shadow(0 0 4px rgba(255,255,255,0.32));
   Notes:
   - Must be visible clearly.
   - Must stay thin.
   - Must NOT look like a border.

2. Soft Under-Glow Base (Floating Effect)
   Apply an elliptical glow underneath the card:
     box-shadow:
       0 18px 38px rgba(0,0,0,0.10),
       0 0 40px rgba(255,255,255,0.22);
   Notes:
   - This creates the illusion that light is coming from beneath.
   - Keep opacity balanced so the card feels floating.

3. Material Surface Look
   Enhance the gradient softly:
     background: linear-gradient(
       160deg,
       rgba(255,255,255,0.75),
       rgba(250,250,250,0.95)
     );
   Notes:
   - This improves the premium feel.

4. Hover Effect Upgrade
   On hover:
     transform: translateY(-4px);
     filter: drop-shadow(0 0 6px rgba(255,255,255,0.42));
     box-shadow:
       0 22px 42px rgba(0,0,0,0.14),
       0 0 55px rgba(255,255,255,0.28);

5. Dark Mode Revision (Very Important)
   Rim-light:
     filter: drop-shadow(0 0 4px rgba(255,255,255,0.18));
   Base glow:
     box-shadow:
       0 18px 35px rgba(0,0,0,0.55),
       0 0 28px rgba(255,255,255,0.10);
   Background:
     background: linear-gradient(
       160deg,
       #222222,
       #1b1b1b
     );

6. Do not modify spacing, padding, card titles, or any admin logic.  
7. Only enhance visuals — zero functional changes.

DELIVERABLES:
- Updated CSS/Tailwind styles with stronger rim-light and base glow.
- Apply globally to all admin dashboard cards.
- Ensure equal visibility in both light mode and dark mode.
