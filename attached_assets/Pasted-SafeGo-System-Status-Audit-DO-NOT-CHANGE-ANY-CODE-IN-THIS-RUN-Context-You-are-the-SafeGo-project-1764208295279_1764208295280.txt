SafeGo System Status Audit – DO NOT CHANGE ANY CODE IN THIS RUN

Context:
You are the SafeGo project architect and code reviewer. SafeGo is a unified Ride + Food + Parcel platform with four roles: customer, driver, restaurant, and admin. The system already has:
- Unified payout system (driver + restaurant)
- Driver app features D1–D22 (profile, documents, wallet, payouts, safety, support, performance, incentives, trust score, navigation drawer, etc.)
- Restaurant app features C1+ (dashboard, status controls, payouts, etc.)
Security hardening phase 1 and 2 are also implemented (headers, rate limiting, OTP, audit logs, payout 2FA, etc.).

Goal of this task:
Give me a precise STATUS REPORT only. Do NOT build new features, do NOT refactor code, and do NOT change the database in this run. I just want to know what is DONE, what is PARTIAL, and what is MISSING.

Instructions:
1. Scan the current codebase and documentation (including replit.md and any task notes) for:
   - Driver app (D1–D22 or similar sections)
   - Restaurant app (C1+ sections)
   - Payout & wallet system
   - Security hardening and KYC flows
   - Navigation and header actions (drawer, notifications, language globe, profile icon)

2. For each area, produce a structured summary with three clear lists:
   A) COMPLETED – implemented, wired to real routes/APIs, and working in UI
   B) PARTIAL / BUGGY – implemented but with missing pieces, broken routes, or bad UX
   C) NOT IMPLEMENTED / MISSING – planned or referenced but not actually built

3. Pay special attention to:
   - Driver side menu / drawer behaviour (open/close, overlay, tap outside to close)
   - Header icons (notifications bell, language globe, profile/avatar actions)
   - Driver profile: date of birth, phone, license plate, and validation rules
   - Driver/restaurant payout methods: payout type dropdown and account type selection
   - Restaurant dashboard (C-1): open/busy switches, quick actions, error states
   - Training / getting started and documents pages for driver and restaurant

4. In your answer:
   - First, give a high-level table: each module vs. Completed / Partial / Missing.
   - Then, for each module, list the key items under the three categories (Completed, Partial, Missing).
   - Finally, give a SHORT, prioritized TODO list ONLY for:
     - Fixing partial/buggy items
     - Finishing clearly missing pieces that are required for a professional Uber-level web app.

5. Very important:
   - Do NOT invent totally new product ideas.
   - Only suggest work that is directly needed to finish or polish the existing flows.
   - Do NOT apply any code changes in this run; this is an analysis/status pass only.

Now run your analysis and return the full status report as described.
