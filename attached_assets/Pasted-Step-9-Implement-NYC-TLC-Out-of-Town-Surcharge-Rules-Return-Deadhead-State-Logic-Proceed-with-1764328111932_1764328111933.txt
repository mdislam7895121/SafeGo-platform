Step 9 — Implement NYC TLC Out-of-Town Surcharge Rules (Return Deadhead + State Logic)

Proceed with Step 9 of the NYC TLC regulatory system. Add the mandatory Out-of-Town rules with the following specifications:

1. Return Deadhead Logic:
   - Whenever a trip leaves NYC (pickup inside NYC, dropoff outside NYC),
     apply the TLC Return Deadhead Fee.
   - Fee amount: $15.00 flat.
   - Applies for dropoff in:
       • New Jersey
       • Long Island (Nassau, Suffolk)
       • Westchester County
       • Any other non-NYC county
   - Does NOT apply to NYC → NYC trips.
   - Does NOT apply to cross-state surcharge simultaneously.
   - This fee is non-commissionable.

2. State & County Boundary Detection:
   - Use geo-boundary polygon matching.
   - Identify:
       • NYC counties (NY, Kings, Bronx, Queens, Richmond)
       • Out-of-town NY counties (Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester)
       • New Jersey boundary
   - Return Deadhead applies when:
       pickupCounty ∈ NYC AND dropoffCounty ∉ NYC.

3. Fare Pipeline Position:
   Insert AFTER:
       • NYC TLC Base Fare Enforcement
       • Congestion Fee
       • Airport Fees
       • AVF ($0.30)
       • HVRF ($0.75)
       • BCF (2.75%)
       • Long Trip Surcharge (if any)
   BEFORE:
       • SafeGo Service Fee
       • Platform Commission
       • Driver Earnings Calculation

4. API Response Fields:
   - tlcOutOfTownFee
   - tlcOutOfTownApplied (boolean)

5. UI Requirements:
   - Add FareBreakdown line item:
       "Out-of-Town Return Fee — $15.00"
   - Show only when applied.
   - Use the same icon style as other TLC fees.

6. Test Coverage:
   - NYC → New Jersey → $15 fee
   - NYC → Nassau → $15 fee
   - NYC → Suffolk → $15 fee
   - NYC → Westchester → $15 fee
   - NYC → NYC → $0
   - Brooklyn → Bronx → $0
   - Promo active → still applies
   - Long trip + Out-of-town → both apply correctly
   - Verify exclusion from commission and driver earnings

7. Documentation (replit.md):
   - Add Out-of-Town Surcharge section with full rule explanation,
     maps, examples, and pipeline sequence.
