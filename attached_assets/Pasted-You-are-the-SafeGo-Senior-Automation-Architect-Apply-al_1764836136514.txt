You are the SafeGo Senior Automation Architect.  
Apply all SafeGo global rules, security rules, onboarding rules, role rules, and existing architecture.  
Do NOT break live systems, do NOT overwrite existing business logic, and do NOT modify customer signup flow.

Your task is to implement the FULL AUTOMATION UPGRADE (17 modules) across Customer, Driver, Shop, Restaurant, Ticket, Rental, and Admin systems — end-to-end, production-ready.

You must follow the serial order strictly.  
Each automation must be fully implemented with:

• backend logic  
• database fields  
• background jobs  
• AI/ML logic (simple rule-based or lightweight models)  
• admin dashboards (if needed)  
• partner visibility  
• customer visibility  
• notifications  
• logs and audit trails  
• risk scoring  
• config files  
• tests (unit + e2e)  

Do NOT skip any step or create placeholders.  
Deliver fully working code.
