Follow all SafeGo Master Rules and implement D11: Driver Document Center (Web Version).

GOAL:
Create a complete Uber-style Driver Document Center under /driver/documents, where drivers can upload, view, and manage all required documents. This page must include document cards, upload modals, status badges, expiry indicators, and NYC-specific TLC logic.

1) ROUTE
Create and connect:
- /driver/documents
- Add navigation from Getting Started checklist
- Add optional sidebar link: “Documents”

2) PAGE HEADER
Add:
- Title: “Driver Documents”
- Subtitle: “Upload and manage all required documents to activate your SafeGo driver account.”

3) DOCUMENT CARDS (Each with full UI)
Create document cards for:
- Driver License (front)
- Driver License (back)
- TLC License (NYC only)
- Vehicle Registration
- Vehicle Insurance
- Profile Picture
- SSN Verification (masked; read-only)

For each card include:
- Title
- Short instructions
- Status badge (Pending, Approved, Rejected, Not Submitted)
- Expiry date field for license, registration, insurance
- “Upload” button
- “Update” button if existing file present
- “View Uploaded File” link
- Icon (license, ID card, car, shield)

4) UPLOAD MODAL
For each upload:
- File picker
- Preview image or PDF
- Replace option
- Success + error handling
- Mobile responsive layout

5) STATUS LOGIC (Front-end only)
Represent document statuses using local state or simple data structure:
- "not_submitted"
- "pending"
- "approved"
- "rejected”
Include rejected reason field if needed.

6) NYC TLC LOGIC
Show TLC License card ONLY if:
driverProfile.state === "NY" OR driverProfile.city === "New York".
Hide completely for all other drivers.

7) SSN VERIFICATION CARD
- Read-only
- Masked format (***-**-1234)
- Add a “Verified” badge if status=true

8) INTEGRATION WITH D10 CHECKLIST
- When document uploaded → update checklist item visually
- When approved → mark as completed

9) UI STYLE
- Clean Uber-style card layout
- Clear spacing
- Proper typography
- Color-coded badges
- Smooth mobile layout
- Do NOT modify global theme

10) SECURITY RULES
- No raw PII logged
- Mask SSN always
- Safe file handling
- No backend write logic unless minimal state storage
- Strict role-check: only drivers can access

11) FINALIZE
Build entire page, connect all buttons, test on mobile preview, ensure TLC logic works, and integrate with Getting Started progress.

Complete the full D11 implementation end-to-end.
