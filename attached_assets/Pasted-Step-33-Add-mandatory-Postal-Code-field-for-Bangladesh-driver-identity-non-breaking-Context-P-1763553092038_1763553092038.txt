Step 33 — Add mandatory Postal Code field for Bangladesh driver identity (non-breaking)

Context
- Platform: SafeGo admin + driver KYC system.
- Country-specific identity already implemented for Bangladesh drivers (name, phone, village, post office, thana, district, NID, etc.).
- In the Admin "Document Review" modal for Bangladesh drivers, there is currently NO Postal Code field, and admins cannot edit or see it.
- Business requirement: For Bangladesh drivers, Postal Code must be a mandatory part of the identity profile and visible in the admin review UI.
- Very important: This step must NOT break any previous steps (26: Parcel, 27: BD & USA identity fields, 28: document uploads, 29: driver country filters, 31: wallet/commission, 32: doc review dashboard, etc.).

Goal of Step 33
Add a mandatory Postal Code field for Bangladesh driver identity, end-to-end:
1) Data model
2) KYC input/validation
3) Admin document review + edit modal
4) Backward compatibility and security

Keep everything safe, minimal, and non-breaking.

--------------------
Requirements
--------------------

1. Data model (backend)

- Locate the existing model/schema used for Bangladesh driver identity (for example: `BangladeshDriverIdentity`, `bdIdentity`, or similar).
- Add a new field for postal code:

  - Name suggestion: `postalCode` or `postal_code`
  - Type: string/varchar
  - Length: ideally 4–10 chars (supporting BD postal codes, but don’t over-restrict). For validation we will use 4–6 numeric characters.
  - Nullable at database level ONLY to keep backward compatibility with existing rows.
  - No destructive changes (do NOT remove or rename existing columns).

- If the same identity model is reused for customers or other BD roles:
  - Reuse this same field, but keep behaviour consistent and non-breaking.
  - Do NOT change any non-BD logic.

Security phase for this step
- Input validation for new field.
- No schema downgrade / no data loss.
- All access still behind existing RBAC (admin-only where applicable).

2. KYC submission & update flows (driver side)

- Update the Bangladesh driver KYC forms (wherever BD-specific identity is captured) to include a Postal Code field.
- This field must be REQUIRED when:
  - country == Bangladesh AND
  - the driver is creating or updating their BD identity.

Validation rules:
- Required when `countryCode === "BD"`.
- Accept 4–6 digits only: `/^[0-9]{4,6}$/`.
- Show a clear error message on invalid input (e.g. "Postal Code must be 4–6 digits").

Important:
- This must NOT make the APIs break for other countries.
- For non-BD drivers, this field is ignored/not required.

3. Admin Document Review UI for Bangladesh drivers

- Go to the Admin "Document Review" workflow (the modal that shows:
  - Email
  - Country
  - Status
  - Full Name
  - Father’s Name
  - Phone
  - Village
  - Post Office
  - Thana
  - District
  - etc.

- Extend the Identity Information section to also display Postal Code for BD drivers.

Layout suggestion:
- Keep the same two-column layout.
- Add Postal Code next to, or under, Post Office, in a logical address grouping.

Example:

  Identity Information
  - Full Name
  - Father’s Name
  - Phone
  - Village
  - Post Office
  - Postal Code (NEW)
  - Thana
  - District

- If no postal code exists yet (legacy data), show a clear placeholder:
  - e.g. "Not provided" or "Pending update"
  - But do NOT crash or block the page.

4. Admin "Edit Bangladesh Profile" modal

- In the "Edit Bangladesh Profile" modal (where admin can edit BD identity for a driver):
  - Add a Postal Code input field.
  - It must be required when saving updates (for BD drivers).
  - Apply the same 4–6 digit validation.

- Behaviour:
  - If existing BD identity has no postal code (old records), allow admin to add it the first time.
  - Do not silently discard invalid input; show inline error and prevent save.

5. API behaviour & backward compatibility

- For API responses that include BD identity:
  - Include the new `postalCode` field as nullable/optional.
  - Do NOT make it required in JSON for existing consumers.
  - For new create/update requests:
    - Require `postalCode` when BD.
    - Reject invalid or missing values with a clear error message.

- No breaking changes:
  - No existing route signatures should change in a way that would break clients.
  - Only additive changes and stricter validation for BD driver KYC.

6. Logging & security

- Treat postal code as low-sensitivity address metadata:
  - It can be logged as part of normal admin audit if you already log BD identity fields.
  - Make sure NO new endpoint bypasses existing auth/role checks:
    - Only authenticated admins can read/update BD identity via admin routes.
    - Normal drivers can only see/edit their own identity via existing protected endpoints.

- Do not introduce any open endpoints that expose driver identity without auth.

7. UI/UX details

- Ensure the Document Review modal scroll + layout still work correctly on mobile and desktop.
- Postal Code label should be clear:
  - Use "Postal Code" (not "ZIP").
- Make sure the new field appears only where it makes sense:
  - BD specific identity blocks.
  - Do NOT show Postal Code for non-BD identity sections.

--------------------
Tests & Acceptance Criteria
--------------------

1) Migration / data layer
- App starts without migration errors.
- Existing BD driver records load correctly, even if postalCode is null.
- No schema or runtime errors in logs.

2) BD driver KYC form
- When country = BD:
  - Leaving Postal Code blank should show validation error and block submission.
  - Entering non-numeric or wrong length value should show error.
  - Valid 4–6 digit code should allow submission.

3) Admin Document Review
- For a BD driver with postal code set:
  - Document Review modal shows Postal Code alongside other identity fields.
  - Approve / Reject flows still work with no errors.
- For legacy BD driver without postal code:
  - Document Review modal loads.
  - Postal Code shows “Not provided” or similar.
  - No crashes.

4) Admin Edit Bangladesh Profile
- When editing a BD driver with no postal code:
  - Admin can enter a valid code and save successfully.
  - After save, subsequent views show the saved postal code.
- When entering invalid code (e.g. “123”, “abcd”):
  - Save is blocked with validation message.

5) Non-BD drivers
- USA / other country drivers remain unaffected:
  - No new required fields.
  - Their KYC flows, document review, and edit screens still work as before.

6) Security checks
- All new/updated routes are still behind existing RBAC (admin-only where appropriate).
- No sensitive data leakage in logs beyond existing behaviour.
- No console errors in frontend.

If any part of this step conflicts with earlier SafeGo steps (26–32), prioritise:
- NO breaking changes,
- Country-specific BD rules only,
- Strong validation and admin-only access for identity data.

Please implement Step 33 exactly with this scope, and then summarise what changed (files/tables, endpoints, and UI components) once done.
