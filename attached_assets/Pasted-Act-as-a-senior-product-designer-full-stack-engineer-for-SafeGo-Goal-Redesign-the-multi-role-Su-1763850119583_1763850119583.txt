Act as a senior product designer + full-stack engineer for SafeGo.

Goal:
Redesign the multi-role Support chat UI so that:
- The chat panel sits on one side (right) in a clean, professional layout
- The left side shows role-specific topics / quick questions and verification info
- Drivers, riders, restaurant owners, and parcel couriers all get role-based quick questions
- All existing backend verification, logging, and live chat logic stays intact

Very important SafeGo rules (do NOT break these):
- Four roles: customer (rider), driver, restaurant, admin (plus parcel/delivery if already in code)
- Keep all existing KYC, payouts, tax, wallet, and support verification logic
- Keep all existing Prisma models, Zod validation, auth middleware, and API routes
- Do NOT remove server-side verification or 403 “verification required” checks
- Do NOT break any existing URLs (/driver/support, /rider/support, /restaurant/support, etc.)
- Do NOT re-introduce the old ticket system. We only use live chat.

### 1. Page scope and layout

Apply this redesign to all existing support pages for logged-in users:
- Driver support page (current path: /driver/support)
- Rider support page (whatever the current rider support path is)
- Restaurant support page (restaurant support path)
- Parcel / delivery support page (if present)

On desktop and tablet:
- Use a two-column layout inside the existing SafeGo container.
- LEFT COLUMN (about 35–40% width):
  - A compact "Support overview + verification" card:
    - Title: “SafeGo [Role] Support” (e.g., SafeGo Driver Support, SafeGo Rider Support, etc.)
    - Subtext: “We’re here to help with your [role-specific text].”
    - A small verified row that reuses the existing verification data (name, masked phone/email, last verified timestamp).
  - Below that, a “Quick topics” / FAQ section with role-based chips or buttons (see section 2).
- RIGHT COLUMN (about 60–65% width):
  - The live chat conversation:
    - Header bar with: SafeGo logo, “Live Support”, a small badge “Bot” / “Agent” depending on who last replied.
    - Scrollable message history.
    - Message input box at the bottom.
    - A visible “End chat” / “Close conversation” button or link (top-right of chat header) which:
      - Soft-closes the UI (clears current conversation from the view or shows a “Conversation closed – Start new chat” state).
      - Does NOT delete DB records or break logging.

On mobile:
- Use a stacked layout:
  - First show the verification + quick topics section.
  - Below that, the chat panel full-width.
- Keep everything readable and touch-friendly.

### 2. Role-based quick topics / auto questions

Use the existing role detection (from auth/session) to show different quick topics.  
Implement them as clickable chips or buttons under the verification card, above the chat.

When the user taps a quick topic:
- Automatically send a pre-defined user message into the chat (as if the user typed it).
- Immediately show a bot reply using the existing bot pipeline or a simple canned text answer.
- Also tag the conversation topic internally (for future analytics / escalation).

Suggested topics (you can adjust wording slightly but keep the intent):

Driver:
- “Payments & Wallet”
- “Payout methods or cash-out”
- “Trips & riders issues”
- “Documents & vehicle”
- “Tax information”
- “Account & login”

Rider (customer):
- “Payments & refunds”
- “Trip or ride issues”
- “Promotions & credits”
- “Safety & security”
- “Account & login”

Restaurant:
- “Orders & delivery issues”
- “Menu & pricing updates”
- “Payouts & earnings”
- “Device / tablet issues”
- “Account & documents”

Parcel / delivery (if applicable):
- “Pickup or dropoff issues”
- “Lost or damaged items”
- “Delivery delays”
- “Address or location problems”

For each quick topic, wire a simple mapping:
- topicKey → userMessageTemplate → initialBotReplyTemplate

Keep these templates in a separate config file (e.g., supportTopics.ts) so they are easy to extend later without touching core logic.

### 3. Verification behaviour (before chat)

We already have verification in place. Reuse it exactly, but surface it more clearly in the UI:

- When the support page loads:
  - Fetch the existing verification data (user id, role, country, basic KYC/tax status if already exposed).
  - Show a small “Verified” pill or status text in the left column card.
- When user clicks “Start chat” or the first quick topic:
  - Ensure verification is still valid server-side using the existing checks.
  - If verification fails, return 403 and show a friendly message:
    - “We need to confirm your account details before chat. Please update your documents or contact support by email.”
  - Otherwise, allow the chat to open and save verification timestamp (as it does now).

Do NOT relax any security checks. Only reuse the existing endpoints.

### 4. Chat UX details

- Make sure the chat input area always stays visible above the keyboard on mobile.
- Add a small “Topics” strip just above the message input:
  - Show the same role-based quick topics there as compact chips (especially useful once the user scrolls).
- Add a “Back to Help Center” link or button aligned with existing navigation patterns so the user can easily exit the support page.
- Keep the new live chat implementation (no more “Create New Ticket” code).
- Ensure only one active conversation per user/role as currently implemented.

### 5. Technical constraints

- Keep all existing backend:
  - Prisma models and migrations
  - Zod validation
  - API routes and auth middleware
  - Fraud, logging, or audit events
- Only adjust or extend:
  - React components for the Support pages
  - Layout / CSS / UI state
  - A small topic-mapping config for quick questions
- Make sure you don’t introduce any console or TypeScript errors.
- Reuse existing components (buttons, cards, layout grid) to keep SafeGo visual consistency.

### 6. What to show me when you’re done

When you finish, please:
- List which files you changed (front-end + any small config).
- Summarize how the layout behaves on:
  - Desktop driver support page
  - Mobile driver support page
  - One other role (rider or restaurant)
- Confirm that:
  - Verification and 403 behaviour still works.
  - Live chat works end-to-end with quick topics.
  - “End chat / Close conversation” works without breaking history.

Do NOT start any other new feature. Focus only on:
- Side-by-side professional layout for Support
- Role-based quick topics
- Clean start / end chat flow
- Keeping all security and verification rules intact
