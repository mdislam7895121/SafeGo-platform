STATUS FLOWS (do not rename)
- Rides: requested → searching_driver → accepted → driver_arriving → in_progress → completed/cancelled_x
- Food: placed → accepted → preparing → ready_for_pickup → picked_up → on_the_way → delivered/cancelled_x
- Parcels: requested → searching_driver → accepted → picked_up → on_the_way → delivered/cancelled_x

ONBOARDING
- Customer: simple signup + address + emergency contact + country KYC, verification_status="pending".
- Drivers/Restaurants: separate partner onboarding after login, multi-step with documents and payout info.

NOTIFICATIONS
- New rides, food, parcel updates, KYC decisions, admin alerts.

All changes MUST be additive and non-breaking.

====================================================
CURRENT BUG – BACK BUTTON NOT WORKING
====================================================

Screen: Admin → Security → Access Reviews  
Route: /admin/access-reviews  
Header shows: "← Back to Security" above "Periodic Access Review".

Problem:
- The "Back to Security" control is visible but clicking it does nothing. 
- It does not navigate to any route and behaves like plain text.

Goal:
- Make the "Back to Security" control a fully working back button using the existing router.
- Keep the current text and icon, only fix wiring and layout if needed.

====================================================
IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS
====================================================

1) Locate the Access Reviews page component
   - Find the React (or framework) component used for /admin/access-reviews.
   - Example: AccessReviewsPage, AccessReviewScreen, etc.

2) Find the “Back to Security” UI element
   - It might be:
     - A simple <span> or <div>
     - A button without onClick
     - A Link with missing "to" / "href"
   - Identify exactly where it is rendered in the header.

3) Hook it up to the router
   - Use the existing router used elsewhere in the admin console
     (e.g., React Router `useNavigate`, `Link`, Next.js `Link`, etc.).
   - Determine the correct target route for “Security”:
     - If there is a dedicated Security landing page (e.g. "/admin/security"), use that.
     - If not, use the main admin dashboard (e.g. "/admin") or the root Security section parent that already exists in the sidebar.
   - Implement one of the patterns below (depending on the framework):

   Example (React Router v6):
   - const navigate = useNavigate();
   - <button onClick={() => navigate("/admin/security")}>Back to Security</button>

   Example (Link-based):
   - <Link to="/admin/security" className="back-link">← Back to Security</Link>

   Use the **actual existing route** in the codebase for the Security root, not a new one.

4) Keep the header layout consistent
   - Place the Back button inside the PageHeader / header container, not floating independently.
   - Layout pattern:
     [ ← Back to Security ] [ Title + Subtitle ] [ (optional actions) ]
   - Do not change fonts or theme tokens; reuse existing header styles.

5) Clickability and accessibility
   - Ensure the element is a <button> or <a>/<Link> with:
     - cursor: pointer
     - aria-label like "Go back to Security"
   - Make sure no overlay or container with `pointer-events: none` is covering the button area.
   - The button must respond on first click with navigation.

6) Regression checks
   - After the fix, test navigation:

     a) Open /admin/access-reviews from the sidebar.
     b) Click “Back to Security”.
     c) Confirm:
        - The app navigates to the Security parent route (e.g. /admin/security or /admin).
        - URL changes.
        - No console errors.

   - Confirm that:
     - No other pages’ back buttons are broken.
     - No routes, APIs, or database schemas were modified.

====================================================
DELIVERABLES
====================================================

1) A working “Back to Security” control on /admin/access-reviews that:
   - Navigates to the correct Security parent route.
   - Uses the existing router, not window.history hacks.

2) Header layout remains consistent with other admin pages (Safety Center, Activity Logs, etc.).

3) A short comment in the Access Reviews header code explaining:
   - Which route “Back to Security” navigates to.
   - That this is an admin-only navigation helper.
