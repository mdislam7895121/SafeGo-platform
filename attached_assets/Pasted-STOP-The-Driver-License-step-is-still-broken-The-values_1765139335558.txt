STOP. The Driver License step is still broken.

The values from the Personal Information step are automatically populating the Driver License fields. This is a critical form state linking bug.

Current incorrect behavior:
- full_legal_name is being injected into driver_license_number
- date_of_birth is being injected into driver_license_expiry
- home_address.state is being injected into driver_license_state
- The user cannot see or provide the correct license details

You must FIX the state mapping immediately.

========================================
A. SafeGo master rules – KEEP ALL
========================================
(Do not break roles, KYC, admin, collections, commission logic, security rules, or status flows.)

========================================
B. FIX FORM STATE LINKS
========================================

1. Open the US Driver Onboarding V2 form container:
   - The parent component controlling the onboarding steps
   - The code that carries formState from Personal Info → Driver License step

2. REMOVE any auto-mapping such as:
   - driver_license_number = fullLegalName
   - driver_license_expiry = dateOfBirth
   - driver_license_state = homeAddress.state

3. ENSURE these fields are initialized EMPTY:

   driver_license_number: ""
   driver_license_state: ""
   driver_license_expiry: ""
   driver_license_front_image: null
   driver_license_back_image: null

4. ENSURE these fields are NOT derived from personal info step:
   - DO NOT map values from:
     - full_legal_name
     - date_of_birth
     - home_address.state
     - any previous step field

5. FIX the Controller bindings:

The Driver License inputs must be wired ONLY to their own fields:

   name="driver_license_number"
   name="driver_license_state"
   name="driver_license_expiry"

NO OTHER FIELD from step 1 should update these values.

6. FIX validation schema:
The schema keys must match EXACTLY:

   driver_license_number: z.string().min(1)
   driver_license_state: z.string().min(1)
   driver_license_expiry: z.string().min(1)

7. Ensure Next button logic checks these EXACT fields, not personal info fields.

========================================
C. TEST AFTER FIX
========================================

1) Fill Personal Info step → Next
   - Driver License Number MUST be empty
   - License Issuing State MUST be empty
   - License Expiration Date MUST be empty

2) Allow manual entry:
   - Type license number
   - Select state
   - Pick expiration date

3) Confirm error messages disappear when values are provided.

4) Confirm Next button becomes active.

========================================
D. REPORT BACK
========================================

Explain:
- What code was auto-populating the driver license fields?
- Which file controlled the step state transfer?
- How the mapping was removed?
- Confirmation that:
   - Driver License fields start empty
   - Personal info no longer overwrites them
   - Binding works
   - Validation works
