You are working on the SafeGo global platform. Implement this task end-to-end.

SAFEGO MASTER RULES (MUST FOLLOW)
1) Roles: customer, driver, restaurant, admin. Never mix access. Role-based permissions required.
2) Services: ride-hailing, food delivery, parcel delivery must all be supported.
3) Country rules: BD and US must have different onboarding & KYC rules:
   - BD mandatory fields: father_name, date_of_birth, present_address, permanent_address, NID number + front/back images, emergency contact, verification_status, is_verified
   - US mandatory fields: date_of_birth, home_address, emergency contact, government_id_type, government_id_last4, driver license + image + expiry, ssn_last4 optional, verification_status, is_verified
4) Admin panel must support: verify customers/drivers/restaurants, approve/reject KYC with rejection_reason, update pricing/fees/commissions, block/unblock, manage payouts, view negative balances.
5) Collections must exist and remain intact: rides, food_orders, deliveries with full status flows, payment details, timestamps, rating/feedback.
6) Commission rules must remain:
   - CASH ride: driver gets cash, SafeGo commission becomes negative driver_wallet_balance; weekly settlement by admin.
   - CASH food: restaurant gets cash, commission becomes negative restaurant_wallet; admin can settle.
   - Online: SafeGo keeps commission automatically.
7) Security rules: customers cannot view driver docs; drivers cannot view customer sensitive info; restaurants isolated; only admin changes pricing/commission/verification/blocking.
8) Status flows must remain complete:
   - Ride: requested → searching_driver → accepted → driver_arriving → in_progress → completed/cancelled_x
   - Food: placed → accepted → preparing → ready_for_pickup → picked_up → on_the_way → delivered/cancelled_x
   - Parcel: requested → searching_driver → accepted → picked_up → on_the_way → delivered/cancelled_x
9) Non-breaking: do NOT rename/remove existing fields/APIs/routes. Only ADD new configs/entries. Backward-compatible only.

TASK
We already defined a SafeGo-branded vehicle catalog for US. Now we must ADD the same set of vehicle types for Bangladesh (BD) too, without using Uber names anywhere.

Vehicle types to ensure exist for Bangladesh (BD):

Passenger Ride Vehicles (BD):
1. SafeGo Standard
2. SafeGo Comfort
3. SafeGo Eco (Hybrid / Electric)
4. SafeGo Family (6–7 seater)
5. SafeGo Executive
6. SafeGo Executive SUV
7. SafeGo Schedule (Advance booking)
8. SafeGo Hourly (Time-based)
9. SafeGo City Taxi (city-regulated)

Delivery / Parcel Vehicles (BD) — same list previously used for US delivery:
10. SafeGo Car Delivery
11. SafeGo Van Delivery
12. SafeGo Connect (same-day parcel)

IMPORTANT: In addition, do NOT break existing BD-only vehicles already present (e.g., Bike/CNG/Pickup/Mini Truck). Those must remain available according to BD config. This task is additive.

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
A) Global Vehicle Master (required)
- Ensure the platform has (or add, if missing) a single global “vehicle master” definition source:
  - db table OR config file OR seed list (use existing pattern)
- For each vehicle entry (BD), include:
  - vehicle_key (stable internal ID; no spaces; snake_case)
  - display_name (SafeGo branded names exactly as listed)
  - country: "BD"
  - services_supported: [ride] or [food, parcel]
  - vehicle_class: sedan/suv/xl/taxi/eco/van/car_delivery/etc.
  - capacity: passenger_count OR parcel_capacity_level
  - is_premium (true/false)
  - is_time_based (true/false)
  - is_scheduled (true/false)
  - is_enabled (default false unless pricing exists)

B) Country filtering (required)
- Customer apps must show vehicle options ONLY for the selected country (BD vs US).
- Vehicles must only appear if:
  - country matches
  - pricing exists (or a default price config exists)
  - vehicle is enabled for that country

C) Pricing & visibility rule (required)
- If pricing is missing for a vehicle in BD, auto-hide it from customer UI (do not show empty cards).
- Admin must be able to enable/disable a vehicle and set pricing per country.

D) Driver eligibility (required)
- Executive/Executive SUV: stricter eligibility flags (no driver doc exposure to customers).
- City Taxi: allow city-level enable rules (BD cities).
- Schedule/Hourly: ensure ride workflow supports scheduled/time-based flags without breaking normal rides.

E) UI safety (required)
- Absolutely NO white screens.
- Add empty-state messages:
  - Ride: “No ride options available right now.”
  - Delivery: “Delivery is not available in your area right now.”
- Add error boundary if not present and ensure route pages render at least a header + placeholder.

F) Admin panel (required)
- Add/extend admin UI for “Vehicle Types & Pricing” to manage:
  - country selection (BD/US)
  - enable/disable vehicles
  - set base fare, per_km, per_min, minimum fare
  - for delivery: base fee, per_km, weight/size multipliers if present
- Keep permissions: only admin can change this.

G) Data models / collections (required)
- Ensure rides, food_orders, deliveries store:
  - selected_vehicle_key
  - selected_vehicle_display_name
  - country
  - pricing snapshot at time of order (so pricing changes don’t affect past records)

H) Notifications (required)
- When a vehicle is disabled or pricing missing, show clear admin warnings and avoid user-facing failures.

DELIVERABLES
1) Implement the BD additions and confirm no existing behavior is broken.
2) Provide a short report:
   - files/modules changed
   - where the vehicle definitions live
   - how country filtering & pricing-hide works
3) Provide a quick manual test checklist:
   - BD customer can see the new 12 vehicles (when pricing enabled) plus existing BD vehicles
   - US customer still sees US list correctly
   - No white screens on /ride /food /parcel /shops /tickets
4) Confirm all changes are backward-compatible.

Proceed now and finish in one pass.
