We are working on SafeGo admin → Driver Management.

Problem:
- On the Admin Dashboard “Platform Overview” card it shows `Total Drivers = 49`.
- But on `/admin/drivers` the "Drivers" table shows "No drivers found" even when there are active/verified drivers.
- Filters on the page: All Countries, All Statuses, All Verification. Even with these defaults we see an empty state.

Goal:
Make the Admin Driver Management page show the same drivers that are counted in the Platform Overview stats, with basic filters working.

Please do the following:

1) Backend: Admin driver listing endpoint
- Locate the existing driver profile model (DriverProfile / driver_profile table).
- Implement an admin-only endpoint, for example:
  - `GET /api/admin/drivers`
- Requirements:
  - Return a paginated list of drivers with:
    - driverProfileId
    - full name
    - email
    - country
    - city (if available)
    - verification status (KYC / documents)
    - driver account status (active / suspended / pending)
    - totalTrips, rating, yearsActive (if those metrics already exist; otherwise return 0 / null safely).
  - Support filters:
    - country (All Countries = no filter)
    - status (All Statuses = no filter; otherwise active / inactive / pending / suspended, based on existing enum/flags)
    - verification (All Verification = no filter; otherwise verified / unverified / pending).
  - Make sure the query uses the SAME source of truth as the dashboard “Total Drivers” metric, or document the difference and then align them so counts are consistent.
  - Protect with admin RBAC (admin role only).

2) Frontend: wire `/admin/drivers` page to the API
- File is something like `client/src/pages/admin/drivers.tsx` (or similarly named).
- Replace any fake data / TODO state so that:
  - On initial load it calls `GET /api/admin/drivers` with no filters and shows the returned list.
  - The filters (country, status, verification) update the query parameters and refetch.
  - The empty state only appears when the API actually returns zero results, not when the call fails.
- Show at least:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Country
  - Status
  - Verification
  - Created date (or years active) if available.

3) Consistency with dashboard cards
- Find where the “Total Drivers” card gets its value (e.g. `adminDashboardService` or analytics query).
- Ensure that:
  - Both the dashboard card and `/api/admin/drivers` are counting from the same driver_profile source.
  - Soft-deleted or test drivers are handled consistently (either excluded everywhere or counted everywhere, but consistent).
- If there is a difference (e.g. card counts all drivers, table shows only KYC-complete drivers), make that logic explicit and document it in `replit.md` under an “Admin Driver Management” section.

4) Safety and KYC
- Ensure the endpoint does NOT return sensitive fields like full SSN, document numbers, raw file paths, etc.
- It’s fine to return high-level flags like `kycStatus`, `hasDocuments`, `isSuspended`.

5) Testing
- Seed or reuse my existing driver account so that:
  - It appears in the Total Drivers card.
  - It also appears in the `/admin/drivers` table.
- Confirm:
  - With filters set to “All”, my driver row is visible.
  - Changing filters (e.g. by country or status) behaves as expected.
  - No console errors on the admin drivers page.

Finally:
- Update `replit.md` with:
  - The new endpoint contract.
  - Filter behavior.
  - Any limitations or future improvements (e.g. pagination, advanced search).
- Leave a short summary in the agent log explaining that the Admin Driver Management page is now showing real drivers and is consistent with the dashboard metrics.
