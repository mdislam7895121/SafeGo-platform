SAFEGO GLOBAL CONSTRAINTS – DO NOT BREAK

- Do NOT change any of the four roles or their permissions: Customer, Driver, Restaurant (Merchant), Admin.
- Do NOT change country-specific KYC and profile rules:
  - BD: father_name, date_of_birth, present_address, permanent_address, NID (number + images), emergency contact, verification_status, is_verified.
  - US: date_of_birth, home_address, emergency contact, government_id_type, government_id_last4, drivers: license + image + expiry (+ optional ssn_last4), verification_status, is_verified.
- Do NOT rename or delete any existing database collections or fields for:
  - rides, food_orders, deliveries
  - wallets, commissions, payouts, balances
- Do NOT break commission rules:
  - Cash rides → driver keeps cash, SafeGo commission becomes negative driver_wallet_balance.
  - Cash food orders → restaurant keeps cash, commission becomes negative restaurant_wallet_balance.
  - Online payment → SafeGo keeps commission automatically.
  - Admin can settle and mark negative balances as paid.
- Do NOT weaken security rules:
  - Customers cannot see driver documents.
  - Drivers cannot see customer NID or sensitive info.
  - Restaurants cannot see each other’s data.
  - Only Admin can change pricing, commissions, verification, blocking.
  - Users can only update their own profile.
- Do NOT break status flows:
  - rides: requested → searching_driver → accepted → driver_arriving → in_progress → completed / cancelled_x
  - food_orders: placed → accepted → preparing → ready_for_pickup → picked_up → on_the_way → delivered / cancelled_x
  - deliveries: requested → searching_driver → accepted → picked_up → on_the_way → delivered / cancelled_x
- Do NOT change existing APIs or routes; only add missing navigation controls and fix broken links in a backward-compatible way.

TASK: FULL ADMIN DASHBOARD NAVIGATION & BACK-BUTTON AUDIT

Goal: Make the entire SafeGo Admin Console feel professional and complete by:
- ensuring every sub-page has a clear way to go back,
- fixing any button/link that does nothing or shows 404,
- keeping the existing glow-card design and layout.

Work ONLY on the Admin Panel frontend (React/Next/etc.), not on backend logic.

====================================================
1) GLOBAL NAVIGATION PATTERN
====================================================

Implement a consistent navigation pattern across ALL admin sections:

- For every sub-page (anything that is not the main `/admin` dashboard), add:
  - A top-left Back button:
      - icon: left arrow
      - label: “Back to [Parent Section]”
  - OR a breadcrumb:
      - e.g., Dashboard / Restaurants / Restaurant Details
- The Back button should:
  - first try `router.back()` (history),
  - or fall back to the appropriate parent route:
      - Promotions Center → `/admin/promotions`
      - Create Promotion → `/admin/promotions`
      - Restaurant Management → `/admin/restaurants`
      - Add Restaurant → `/admin/restaurants`
      - Driver Management → `/admin/drivers`
      - Add Driver → `/admin/drivers`
      - User Management → `/admin/users`
      - Wallets → `/admin/wallets`
      - Payouts → `/admin/payouts`
      - KYC Approvals → `/admin/kyc-approvals`
      - Safety & Risk Center → `/admin/safety`
      - Document Center → `/admin/documents`
      - People & KYC Center → `/admin/people-kyc`
      - Promotions Center → `/admin/promotions`
      - Parcels → `/admin/parcels`
      - Any ride/food/delivery detail page → its respective list page.

Make sure the Back control is:
- visible on laptop and tablet widths,
- aligned with the page title (same header row).

====================================================
2) FULL CLICK-ACTION & LINK AUDIT
====================================================

Go through the Admin Dashboard and test EVERY interactive element:

Sections to cover at minimum:
- Main Dashboard:
  - Real-Time Analytics cards
  - Quick Actions (Add Driver, Add Restaurant, Create Promotion, Adjust Pricing)
  - Platform Overview cards
  - Management cards (Onboarding Overview, Notification Center, People & KYC Center, Safety & Risk Center, KYC Approvals, Document Center)
- Users / People & KYC:
  - Users list, filters, row actions (view, edit, block/unblock)
- Drivers:
  - Drivers list, Pending KYC, Suspended, Blocked, details pages
- Restaurants:
  - Restaurant Management (list, filters, Columns button, details, edit)
  - Add Restaurant flow
- Parcels:
  - Parcel Delivery Statistics, parcel list, parcel detail pages
- Rides / Orders:
  - rides, food_orders, deliveries lists and detail pages (if present)
- Promotions:
  - Promotions Center
  - Promotion Types (Driver Promotions, Ride Promotions, Referral Bonuses, Opportunity Bonuses)
  - Quick Stats cards
  - Create Promotion page
- Wallets & Payouts:
  - Wallets, Payouts, negative balance views
- KYC & Safety:
  - Onboarding Overview
  - KYC Approvals
  - Safety & Risk Center
  - Document Center
- Notification Center
- Any “Profile” or “Settings” pages for Admin.

For each button/link/icon:
- If it should open a page and instead:
  - does nothing, or
  - shows 404 “Page Not Found”,
  then:
    - either wire it to the correct existing route, OR
    - create a minimal placeholder page (with the correct header + Back button + stub content) if that page is required but not yet implemented.

- If an action is not ready for this phase:
  - disable the button (with a tooltip “Coming soon”) instead of leaving a dead or broken link.

Examples to explicitly verify/fix:
- Quick Action “Create Promotion” → must go to `/admin/promotions?action=create` or proper create page (no 404).
- Add Driver, Add Restaurant → must go to working onboarding forms.
- Management cards → must open their respective sections (no dead clicks).
- Any “View details” row actions → must open a detail view or be clearly disabled.

====================================================
3) BACK BUTTON PLACEMENT RULES (BY MODULE)
====================================================

For each detail / inner page, add specific Back behavior:

- Restaurant detail / edit pages:
  - Back → to `/admin/restaurants` (keeping current filters if possible).

- Driver detail / edit pages:
  - Back → to `/admin/drivers`.

- User detail pages:
  - Back → to `/admin/users`.

- Individual ride / food_order / delivery detail:
  - Back → to respective list (rides / food_orders / deliveries).

- Promotion detail / edit:
  - Back → Promotions Center.

- Wallet or payout detail:
  - Back → Wallets / Payouts list respectively.

- KYC request detail:
  - Back → KYC Approvals list.

- Safety / risk case detail:
  - Back → Safety & Risk Center.

Each of these pages should show:
- Page title,
- Optional breadcrumb,
- Left-aligned Back button in the header row.

====================================================
4) CONSISTENCY & VISUAL RULES
====================================================

- Back button design:
  - Use the same icon, size, and text style on all pages.
  - Place it in the same relative position in the header on every inner page.

- Keep the existing glow-card design and spacing:
  - Do NOT remove glow effects.
  - Ensure new Back button and breadcrumbs visually match the existing design system.

- Do NOT create duplicate routes:
  - Reuse the existing admin routes where they already exist.
  - Only register new routes when needed to remove 404s.

====================================================
5) TESTING SCENARIOS
====================================================

After implementing:

1. From main Admin Dashboard:
   - Click into each Management card → verify:
     - target page loads,
     - Back button appears,
     - Back returns to the Dashboard or parent listing correctly.

2. From each list page:
   - Open a detail/edit view → use Back → confirm it returns to the same list page (ideally same filters).

3. Quick Actions:
   - Click each Quick Action → verify the page opens and has Back navigation.

4. Promotions Center:
   - Verify all Promotion Type cards are clickable where expected.
   - Verify Quick Stats cards behave correctly (if clickable) or are visually static.
   - Click Create Promotion → no 404, Back works.

5. Any remaining link that opens a 404 or does nothing:
   - Fix it or clearly disable it with a tooltip.

Goal:
The SafeGo Admin Dashboard should feel complete and professional: every page reachable from the dashboard must also make it easy to go back, and no visible button or card should be dead or broken.
