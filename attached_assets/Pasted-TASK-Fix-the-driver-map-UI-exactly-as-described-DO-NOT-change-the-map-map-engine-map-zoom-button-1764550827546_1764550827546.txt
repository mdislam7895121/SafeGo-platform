TASK: Fix the driver map UI exactly as described. DO NOT change the map, map engine, map zoom buttons, or any map-related logic.

========================
1) REMOVE WRONG NOTIFICATION ICON OVERLAY
========================
- Remove the notification bell that appears inside or attached to the driver status card (the red-marked area in the screenshot).
- The driver status card must show ONLY:
    • icon (signal)
    • “You’re Online” / “You’re Offline”
    • subtitle line
- No bell, no badge, no extra icon on the right side of the status card.

========================
2) FIX FOOTER BAR SIZE + POSITION
========================
Goal: Footer must NOT cover the left side drawer.

Fix:
- Reduce footer height to 60–70px maximum.
- Footer must FLOAT above the map only — not full overlay width touching the left side.
- Footer must not extend so far up that it overlaps with any drawer or slide menu.
- When side drawer (left or right) is opened, footer must remain below it, not covering it.

Position:
- Footer is pinned at the bottom of the screen.
- Footer stays inside safe area.
- Drawer overlays appear ABOVE the map, not above the footer.

========================
3) FOOTER LAYOUT (3 SECTIONS)
========================
LEFT SECTION:
- Icon: grid/hamburger icon which opens the “Trip Type Selector Drawer”.
- Must stay completely visible and clickable even when drawer slides.

CENTER SECTION:
- Black pill button:
    • Go Online → offline state
    • Go Offline → online state
- This must toggle driver_online_status (existing backend logic)
- Do NOT change its design.

RIGHT SECTION:
- Three-hyphen icon for “Current Trip Info Panel”.
- Must not overlap with footer border.

========================
4) TRIP TYPE SELECTOR DRAWER (LEFT)
========================
- Must slide from the left.
- Footer must NOT cover the drawer.
- Drawer must remain fully visible.
- Must include Uber-style service selection grid (already implemented logic stays).

========================
5) CURRENT TRIP PANEL (RIGHT)
========================
- Must slide from the right.
- Footer must NOT overlap it.

========================
6) ONLINE/OFFLINE TOGGLE LOGIC
========================
- Tapping the black pill button = toggle driver_online_status.
- Must continue working with rides, food_orders, deliveries.
- No reconfirmation popups.

States:
- driver_online_status = offline → show “Go Online”
- driver_online_status = online → show “Go Offline”

========================
7) DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING ELSE
========================
- Do NOT modify map UI.
- Do NOT move zoom buttons.
- Do NOT change markers.
- Do NOT touch admin logic.
- Do NOT modify KYC flows.
- Do NOT edit service preferences logic from previous builds.
- Only fix: notification overlay removal + footer size + footer positioning.

========================
NO QUESTIONS.
Apply all changes in one build exactly as written.
