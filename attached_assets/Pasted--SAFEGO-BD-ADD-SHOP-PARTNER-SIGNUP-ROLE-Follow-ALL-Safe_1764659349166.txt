# SAFEGO BD — ADD "SHOP PARTNER" SIGNUP ROLE
# Follow ALL SafeGo master rules. BD-only. Non-breaking. Additive only.

======================================================
A) PURPOSE
======================================================
Enable the "Shop Partner" role for signup so Bangladeshi shop owners
can create accounts and access the BD Shop Partner onboarding wizard.
This role already exists (dashboard + onboarding + product system),
but it is NOT visible in the signup role selector.

======================================================
B) ROLE DETAILS
======================================================
Internal role ID:
  "shop_partner"

Signup dropdown label (Bangla-first):
  "দোকানদার (Shop Partner)"

Visibility rule:
  Show ONLY when countryCode === "BD"
  (US users must never see this role)

======================================================
C) SIGNUP PAGE INTEGRATION
======================================================
Update the signup role selector to include "shop_partner"
WITHOUT modifying existing roles.

Existing roles:
- customer
- driver
- restaurant
- admin
- ticket_operator   (newly added — keep intact)

Add "shop_partner" as a separate option.

======================================================
D) POST-SIGNUP ROUTING
======================================================
After signup with role = "shop_partner":
Redirect to:
  /shop-partner/onboarding

Onboarding wizard must load:
1) Basic info (Bangla)
2) Shop details
3) Delivery area + shop hours
4) KYC upload (BD rules)
5) Pending verification screen

verification_status must start as "pending"
until admin approves BD KYC.

======================================================
E) SECURITY RULES
======================================================
- Shop Partner cannot access restaurant or operator dashboards.
- Cannot view driver documents or customer sensitive data.
- Only admin can approve or reject.

======================================================
F) NON-BREAKING REQUIREMENTS
======================================================
Do NOT:
- Change existing route names
- Modify schemas
- Touch rides/food_orders/deliveries logic
- Affect US flows

Only extend signup role list + routing.
