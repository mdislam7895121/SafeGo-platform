Task: Fix the real-time traffic indicator on the SafeGo ride booking screen so it reflects actual route conditions instead of a hardcoded or incorrect "Heavy traffic" label.

Scope & Safety Rules
- Do NOT change any fare calculation, surge, promo, commission, or payout logic.
- Do NOT change routing provider or map behavior.
- Only update how the traffic badge text and color are computed and displayed.
- Desktop and mobile must stay visually consistent.

1. Audit current implementation
- Locate where the traffic badge ("Light traffic on this route" / "Heavy traffic") is computed and rendered for the selected ride:
  • Ride details section under the selected vehicle card.
  • Unified booking page: /customer/unified-booking (or the current booking page route).
- Identify whether the label is:
  • Hardcoded to "Heavy traffic", or
  • Based on a placeholder flag that does not use real route data.

2. Use real route data for traffic
- Use the existing route data that we already have for:
  • Distance (e.g., 94.9 mi)
  • Duration (e.g., ~1h 42m)
  • If available from the routing API: duration_in_traffic or a traffic_delay field.
- Implement a stable traffic metric:

  Option A (preferred – if duration_in_traffic or delay is available):
    - baselineDuration = route.duration_without_traffic OR the minimum historical duration for that route if provided.
    - trafficDelay = durationInTraffic - baselineDuration
    - delayPct = (trafficDelay / baselineDuration) * 100

  Option B (fallback – when only distance and duration are available):
    - avgSpeedMph = distanceMiles / durationHours
    - distanceMiles: the route’s distance in miles.
    - durationHours: duration in hours.

3. Define clear thresholds and labels
- Implement one consistent rule set and use it everywhere:

  If using delayPct:
    - delayPct < 10%        → label: "Light traffic on this route" (green badge)
    - 10% ≤ delayPct < 25%  → label: "Moderate traffic" (amber badge)
    - delayPct ≥ 25%        → label: "Heavy traffic" (red badge)

  If using avgSpeedMph:
    - avgSpeedMph ≥ 35 mph  → "Light traffic on this route" (green badge)
    - 20 ≤ avgSpeedMph < 35 → "Moderate traffic" (amber badge)
    - avgSpeedMph < 20 mph  → "Heavy traffic" (red badge)

- If the routing provider returns no traffic info at all:
  • Hide the traffic badge OR show a neutral gray badge: "Traffic info unavailable".
  • Never show "Heavy traffic" by default when we have no data.

4. Keep the existing UI style
- Reuse the current pill / badge component and only change:
  • Text label.
  • Color token (green for light, amber for moderate, red for heavy).
- Do NOT change card layout, spacing, or typography.
- Ensure the traffic badge stays in the same position under the selected ride details.

5. Sync with route selection
- Whenever the user:
  • Changes the route (Fastest, CT-15 N and CT-8 N, I-684 N, etc.), or
  • Changes pickup / dropoff,
  recompute the traffic metric and update the badge immediately.
- The badge must reflect the currently selected route’s conditions, not a previous route.

6. Mobile behavior
- On mobile, ensure:
  • The badge remains visible under the selected ride card.
  • It does not overlap with the "Confirm SafeGo [Category]" button.
  • No horizontal scrolling is required to see the badge.

7. Verification
- Test with at least three scenarios:
  • Short city trip with slow ETA → should show "Heavy traffic" or "Moderate traffic".
  • Normal highway trip (like ~95 mi in ~1h 40m) → should show "Light traffic on this route".
  • Case where traffic data is missing → badge hidden or "Traffic info unavailable", but never "Heavy traffic".

Please implement this in a clean, non-breaking way and keep all pricing and dispatch logic untouched. Only the traffic indicator computation and its UI state should change.
