Continue C7. You already completed the visibility rules.  
Now finish the remaining C7 tasks for vehicle images and full UI polish.

Follow all SafeGo rules strictly.  
Do NOT change any backend logic (pricing, commission, promo, commission split, dispatch, routing).  
Only update the rider-side UI.

1. Vehicle image system (3D, left-angle)

   a) Add / confirm vehicle images under:
      client/src/assets/vehicles/

      Use Uber-style 3D renders with a consistent angle:
      - front-left 3D / ¾ view
      - car slightly rotated so the LEFT side and a bit of the front are visible
      - shot from a slightly elevated camera so the roof is visible
      - white or very light background only

      Filenames:
      - safego-x-sedan.png
      - safego-comfort-sedan.png
      - safego-comfort-xl-suv.png
      - safego-xl-minivan.png
      - safego-black-sedan.png
      - safego-black-suv.png
      - safego-wav-van.png

   b) All images must:
      - share the SAME aspect ratio
      - use the same crop (wheels aligned horizontally at the bottom)
      - be scaled so each car appears same visual size across all categories
      - no stretching or distortion

2. Image mapping helper

   Create or update:
   client/src/utils/getVehicleImage.ts

   Implement a function getVehicleImage(rideTypeCode) that maps:

     SAFEGO_X         → safego-x-sedan.png
     SAFEGO_COMFORT   → safego-comfort-sedan.png
     SAFEGO_COMFORT_XL→ safego-comfort-xl-suv.png
     SAFEGO_XL        → safego-xl-minivan.png
     SAFEGO_BLACK     → safego-black-sedan.png
     SAFEGO_BLACK_SUV → safego-black-suv.png
     SAFEGO_WAV       → safego-wav-van.png

   Export and reuse this helper in all rider views.

3. Apply images everywhere

   Use getVehicleImage in:
   - the ride type carousel cards
   - the selected ride summary panel

   So when the user switches between categories, the corresponding 3D left-angle image updates instantly in both the card and the summary.

4. Image container UI (Uber-style)

   For the image wrapper in the ride card:

   - width: ~92% of the card
   - height: auto, object-fit: contain
   - center horizontally and vertically
   - background:
       linear-gradient(180deg, #FFFFFF 40%, #F8F8F8 100%)
   - border-radius: 12px
   - add soft shadow:
       filter: drop-shadow(0px 4px 14px rgba(0,0,0,0.15));

   Ensure there is consistent padding so the car never touches the edges.

5. SafeGo-branded titles

   Update all visible category titles in the rider UI to:

     SafeGo X
     SafeGo Comfort
     SafeGo Comfort XL
     SafeGo XL
     SafeGo Black
     SafeGo Black SUV
     SafeGo WAV

   Rules:
   - bold title (font-weight: 600)
   - centered under the image, above the price
   - single line only (no wrapping); adjust font-size if needed

6. Professional price presentation

   For each ride card:

   - Current price: large, bold, dark (#000000)
   - Original price (when promo is active): smaller, gray, strikethrough
   - Savings line: “You save $X.XX”
       • color: #16A34A
       • small but readable
       • placed directly under the prices

   The price and commission engine must NOT be changed, only the labels and styling.

7. Card layout polish

   For each ride card (carousel item):

   - padding: 16px inside the card
   - border-radius: 14px
   - border: 1px solid #E5E7EB
   - subtle background: #FFFFFF
   - subtle hover / active shadow:
       box-shadow: 0 8px 24px rgba(15, 23, 42, 0.08) when selected
   - subtext (capacity, ETA, pickup time) in #6B7280, small font (weight 400)

8. Badge system

   Reuse the existing logic, but apply clear visual styles:

   - “Limited” → small yellow pill badge
   - “Popular” (SafeGo X default) → small blue pill badge
   - Promo / saver → green lightning pill (“SafeGo Everyday Saver”)

   Do NOT change how these flags are computed, only how they are rendered.

9. Mobile + desktop behavior

   - Mobile: keep horizontal scroll carousel; cards should remain fully visible with proper padding.
   - Desktop: keep multi-column layout.
   - Both must show the same 3D left-angle vehicle images, SafeGo titles, price styling, and badges.

10. No backend changes

   Confirm that you did NOT modify:
   - fare calculation formulas
   - commission / earnings logic
   - promo application
   - driver eligibility / rideTypeCode values
   - dispatch matching
   - routes or ETA

At the end:

   - Restart the app
   - Take a screenshot of:
       • the rider carousel with all 7 categories visible
       • the selected ride summary panel
   - Confirm that all images are 3D, front-left angle, visually consistent.
   - Confirm no backend logic was changed.
   - Save a checkpoint.
