CRITICAL BUG – FIX DRIVER LICENSE INPUTS NOW (US DRIVER ONBOARDING V2)

The US Driver V2 onboarding is still broken at /partner/driver/register.

Problem:
- On the "Driver License" step, the following fields DO NOT accept typing:
  - Driver License Number
  - License Issuing State
  - License Expiration Date
- This has been broken for more than a day. Preview shows the fields and error text, but when I tap and type, the value stays empty.

You must treat this as a critical blocking bug.

=====================================================================
A. SafeGo master rules (do not break)
=====================================================================
While fixing this, you MUST respect all existing SafeGo rules:

1) Roles: customer, driver, restaurant, admin
   - Separate onboarding, KYC, dashboards, permissions, and status flows.
   - Public signup is customer-only; driver onboarding happens after login.

2) Services: rides, food delivery, parcel delivery
   - Do not break any existing ride/food/parcel flows.

3) Country-specific KYC:
   - BD KYC: father_name, NID, etc. must remain unchanged.
   - US KYC (drivers): date_of_birth, home_address, emergency_contact,
     government_id_type, government_id_last4,
     driver_license_number/state/expiry/images, optional ssn_last4,
     plus TLC fields in NYC TLC zone.
   - Do NOT rename/remove any KYC fields.

4) Admin panel:
   - Admin must still verify drivers/customers/restaurants, approve/reject KYC,
     see rejection_reason, manage pricing/commission/blocking/payouts, and view
     negative balances.

5) Collections: rides, food_orders, deliveries
   - Keep identity, geo, fees+commission, payment, timestamps, rating & feedback.

6) Commission & payouts:
   - Cash ride → driver keeps cash, commission → negative driver_wallet_balance.
   - Cash food → restaurant keeps cash, commission → negative restaurant_wallet.
   - Online payment → SafeGo keeps commission automatically.
   - Admin can settle and mark paid.

7) Security:
   - Customers cannot see driver documents.
   - Drivers cannot see customer KYC.
   - Restaurants cannot see other restaurants.
   - Only admin can change pricing, commission, verification, blocking.
   - Users can edit only their own profile.

8) Status flows for rides/food/parcel must remain intact.

All fixes must be additive and non-breaking.

B. FORCE-FIX THE DRIVER LICENSE FORM BINDINGS
=====================================================================

Now focus ONLY on the "Driver License" step component in the US Driver Onboarding V2 flow (route: /partner/driver/register).

Your goal: make typing WORK in these three fields on both mobile and desktop, even if you have to simplify the implementation.

1) Locate the V2 component
   - Find the component that renders the "Driver License" step with:
     - Driver License Number
     - License Issuing State
     - License Expiration Date
     - Driver License Images
   - This should be the V2 implementation (NOT the legacy V1).

2) Simplify the three inputs to plain, working, controlled fields:

   For the license number field:
   - Use a simple controlled text input with React Hook Form (or equivalent).
   - Pseudocode example (adapt to your tech stack):

     Controller name="driver_license_number" control={control}
       render={({ field }) => (
         <input
           type="text"
           {...field}
         />
       )}

   Requirements:
   - No custom mask or formatter.
   - No extra value={...} overriding `field.value`.
   - No readOnly or disabled.
   - No inputMode="none" or pattern that blocks all chars.

   For the license issuing state:
   - Use a basic <select> bound to the form:

     Controller name="driver_license_state" control={control}
       render={({ field }) => (
         <select {...field}>
           {/* list of states */}
         </select>
       )}

   Requirements:
   - onChange MUST call `field.onChange`.
   - The select must not be disabled.
   - Options must actually be present.

   For the license expiration date:
   - Use a simple date input:

     Controller name="driver_license_expiry" control={control}
       render={({ field }) => (
         <input
           type="date"
           {...field}
         />
       )}

   - Do NOT wrap this in a complex date-picker that can swallow events.
   - Do NOT set readOnly.

3) Remove anything that can freeze input:
   - Remove temporary or leftover props:
     - readOnly
     - disabled
     - value={someConstant}
   - Remove any useEffect that constantly resets these values to empty.
   - If there is a validation schema that runs on every keypress and rejects all input, change it so that:
     - typing is allowed
     - validation errors are shown on blur or on submit, not by blocking keystrokes.

4) Check overlays / pointer-events:
   - Inspect the surrounding layout:
     - Make sure no absolutely-positioned element is placed over the input with pointer-events: auto.
   - If an overlay is used for styling, set `pointer-events: none` on that overlay so taps go to the input.

5) Ensure feature flags are not freezing the form:
   - Confirm `driverOnboardingV2` or any gate is NOT:

     - Re-mounting the component on every keystroke, or
     - Resetting the form to default values continuously.

=====================================================================
C. TESTING REQUIREMENTS
=====================================================================

After making these changes:

1) Manual tests:
   - Desktop Chrome:
     - Type in Driver License Number → characters must appear.
     - Select a state from the dropdown → value must change.
     - Pick an expiration date → value must change.
   - Mobile (Safari or Chrome):
     - Repeat all three actions, confirm typing works.

2) Automated tests:
   - Add/adjust unit tests for the Driver License step component:
     - Typing into fields updates form state.
     - Required-field validation shows messages only when empty on submit.

   - Update integration/E2E tests for US Driver Onboarding V2:
     - Full happy path where the Driver License step is filled successfully.

3) Regression:
   - BD driver onboarding must remain unchanged.
   - Admin driver verification (NYC TLC + Standard US) must still work.
   - Ride/food/parcel flows must still work and not be affected.

D. REPORT BACK
=====================================================================

When done, summarize clearly:
- What was the exact root cause of the non-typing bug.
- Which components/files were changed.
- How the final implementation of the three fields looks now (high level).
- Confirmation that:
  - I can type into all three fields on mobile and desktop.
  - All tests pass.
  - No SafeGo rule or existing feature was broken.
