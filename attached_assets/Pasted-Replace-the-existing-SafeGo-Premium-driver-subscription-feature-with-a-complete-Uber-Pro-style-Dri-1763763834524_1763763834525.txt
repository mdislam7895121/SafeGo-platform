Replace the existing “SafeGo Premium” driver subscription feature with a complete Uber Pro–style Driver Loyalty Points Tier System. Follow all SafeGo company rules and do not break any existing driver dashboard, routes, or onboarding flows.

System Requirements:

1. Remove subscription logic entirely from the driver app.
   - Delete any monthly pricing UI, subscription state fields, and related checks.
   - Keep the navigation link, but rename it to “SafeGo Points.”

2. Create a full tier system based on points:
   - Blue = 500 points
   - Gold = 1000 points
   - Premium = 2000 points
   - Diamond = 3000 points

3. Driver-facing UI for “SafeGo Points” page:
   - Show current tier
   - Show total accumulated points
   - Show progress bar with next-tier milestone
   - Show a full list of tier benefits
   - Add a section “How you earn points” with a simple rules explanation
   - No emojis, clean Uber-style spacing and typography

4. Points Calculation Engine:
   - Each trip grants points (make placeholder values)
   - Leave a function where multiplier rules can be added later
   - Store point totals per driver with audit-safe updates
   - Ensure the engine is compatible with both US and BD drivers

5. Admin Panel Additions:
   Create a new “Points & Tiers Management” module with:
   - Tier definitions (name, required points, color tag)
   - Tier benefits editor (admin can add/remove benefits per tier)
   - Points rules configuration (per-trip base, multipliers, bonus events)
   - All updates logged for audit

6. Migration Rules:
   - Keep the old route working, but redirect all references of “SafeGo Premium” to the new “SafeGo Points” page
   - Ensure no subscription fields remain in the database or UI
   - Do not break any existing driver features or onboarding pages

7. Design Rules:
   - Uber-style layout only: left-aligned content, white background, light grey dividers, no emojis
   - Clean sections with clear headings
   - Fully mobile-responsive

Implement the full system above. After building it, show me:
- Updated routes
- Updated UI components
- Updated admin modules
- Any new API endpoints
- Migration notes
- Testing checklist
