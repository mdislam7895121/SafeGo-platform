I need you to complete the full Partner Onboarding system for the landing page and connect all forms to the Admin Dashboard. Follow this exact specification and treat it as a production-ready requirement.

ADMIN FEATURES REQUIRED:
– Admin can see onboarding lists separately: Drivers, Restaurants, Shops, Tickets
– Filters: Country, City, Status
– Admin can change status and leave notes
– Auto-email or on-screen confirmation
– Region-aware routing: BD-only forms appear only when Bangladesh is selected

SECURITY:
– Validate all inputs
– Rate limit all onboarding endpoints
– Add backend logging for all submissions

After building, test every flow for:
– Correct saving
– Admin visibility
– Status updating
– Region logic
– Error handling

Once done, show me screenshots confirming each onboarding list inside Admin Dashboard.
