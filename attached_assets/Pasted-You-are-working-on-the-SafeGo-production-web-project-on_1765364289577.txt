You are working on the SafeGo production web project on ReplitBackend.
Your goal in this task: 
Redesign and harden the root landing page (/) so that it looks as professional as Uber’s marketing site AND strictly follows SafeGo’s security rules.

IMPORTANT GLOBAL SAFEG0 ARCHITECTURE RULES
1) There is ONE shared SafeGo backend for pricing, GPS, ride status, and region rules. The landing page (/) and the /ride page are ONLY frontend clients that call backend APIs. They may NOT implement their own pricing or status logic.
2) The root domain https://safegoglobal.com must point to this ReplitBackend project. Any old “HTML Codebase” project must NOT be used for the root domain.
3) Auth tokens are handled by the backend via Authorization: Bearer headers and/or secure HttpOnly cookies. Do NOT store secrets or tokens in localStorage or hard-coded in the frontend.

DESIGN GOAL (MATCH ORIGINAL safegoglobal.com DESIGN QUALITY)
Keep the current SafeGo marketing layout that the user already likes, but refine it to a truly professional, Uber-level landing page:

1) HEADER
   - Left: SafeGo logo.
   - Center/left: nav links: Ride, Drive, Business, About.
   - Left of nav or centered: region switcher (Bangladesh, United States, Global).
   - Right: “Log in” text link + “Sign up” primary button.
   - Sticky header on scroll with subtle shadow, no flashy animations.

2) HERO SECTION
   - Left side:
     - H1: “Move, eat, and deliver with SafeGo”
     - Subtext: “One platform for rides, food delivery, and parcel delivery — launching first in Bangladesh.”
     - Two CTAs:
       - Primary button: “Explore services” (scrolls to Services section).
       - Secondary text button: “Become a partner” (scrolls to Partner section).
   - Right side:
     - Card titled “SafeGo Services – All-in-one platform”.
     - Inside: list of services with icons (Rides, Food, Parcel, Shops).
     - Soft rounded card with subtle shadow and light gradient, similar to the user’s original safegoglobal.com design.
   - The whole hero should look balanced, with good typography and spacing on desktop and mobile.

3) SERVICES SECTION
   - Section title: “SafeGo Services”.
   - Subtext: “Everything you need, all in one app. Choose a service to get started.”
   - Row of 4–5 cards:
     - Rides, Food delivery, Parcel delivery, Local shops, Tickets & Travel.
     - Each card: icon, title, one-line description, soft hover effect (slight shadow and scale).

4) PARTNER SECTION
   - Title: “Become a Partner”.
   - Two large cards:
     - “For Drivers & Couriers” with bullets (flexible hours, weekly payouts, clear commissions, bonuses).
     - “For Restaurants & Shops” with bullets (access to thousands of customers, order dashboard, analytics, marketing support).
   - Primary buttons:
     - “Start driving” → /drive.
     - “Register your business” → /business or /restaurant/signup as appropriate.

5) HOW SAFEG0 WORKS SECTION
   - Title: “How SafeGo Works”.
   - Three columns: Rides, Food Delivery, Parcel Delivery.
   - Each column contains 5 simple numbered steps (1..5), explaining the flow.
   - Rides column must match the real app flow: enter pickup/dropoff, see price estimate, confirm ride, track driver, rate & tip.

6) SAFETY & SECURITY SECTION
   - Title: “Safety & Security”.
   - Subtext: “Your safety is our top priority at every step.”
   - Three cards:
     - “Your safety comes first” (for customers: verified drivers, GPS tracking, SOS).
     - “Safety while you work” (for drivers & couriers: verified rider profiles, navigation, support, insurance).
     - “Protecting your data” (for cybersecurity: end-to-end encryption in transit, no data sharing without consent, regular security audits).
   - This section must visually emphasise that SafeGo is “Cybersecurity First”.

7) FAQ SECTION
   - Title: “Frequently Asked Questions”.
   - Use an accordion component with these questions at minimum:
     - How do I request a SafeGo ride?
     - When is SafeGo launching in Bangladesh?
     - How do I become a driver or courier?
     - What payment methods are accepted?
     - How is my safety ensured?
     - Can I schedule rides in advance?

8) FINAL CTA + FOOTER
   - Blue CTA block:
     - Title: “Ready to move with SafeGo?”
     - Subtitle: Short sentence about trusting SafeGo for daily transportation and delivery.
     - Two buttons: “Download the app” (placeholder link) and “Become a partner” (scrolls to Partner section).
   - Footer:
     - Columns: Company (About us, Careers, Press, Blog), Services (Ride, Food, Parcel, Shops), Partners (Drive with us, Deliver with us, Restaurant partners, Shop partners), Support (FAQ, Safety, Contact, Help Center).
     - Bottom line: “© 2025 SafeGo Global. All rights reserved.” and links to Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy.

SECURITY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE LANDING PAGE (MUST IMPLEMENT OR VERIFY)
1) The app must be served only over HTTPS. Ensure the production deployment for safegoglobal.com enforces HTTPS and supports HSTS (Strict-Transport-Security header).
2) Do NOT expose any API keys or secrets in the frontend code. All secrets must stay in environment variables on the backend.
3) Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) in the backend responses for the landing page. Start with:
   - default-src 'self';
   - script-src 'self' https://trusted-analytics-hosts... (only if needed, otherwise keep 'self' only);
   - img-src 'self' data:;
   - style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
   - font-src 'self' data:;
   - frame-ancestors 'none';
4) Set security headers from the backend:
   - X-Frame-Options: DENY
   - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   - Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
   - Permissions-Policy: disable camera/mic/etc unless explicitly needed.
5) If any auth cookie is used on the landing page domain, it must be:
   - HttpOnly
   - Secure
   - SameSite=Lax or Strict
6) CORS must allow only trusted origins like https://safegoglobal.com (and official subdomains), not “*”.
7) Do not run any high-risk actions from the landing page (no direct mutations, no dangerous debug endpoints). Only low-risk read-only APIs (e.g. geolocation suggestions, city list) may be called.
8) Avoid third-party scripts unless they are absolutely necessary. If you add a privacy-friendly analytics tool, integrate it in a way that still passes the CSP and privacy expectations.
9) Clean up any leftover references to the old HTML Codebase project so that users never hit a 404 due to mixed deployments.

DELIVERABLES
- Update the React/Vite landing page component(s) under src/pages or src/components so that the root route (/) matches the above layout and is fully responsive for desktop and mobile.
- Ensure all CTAs point to the correct internal routes (/ride, /drive, /business, /food, /parcel, /shops, /tickets, /driver/signup, /restaurant/signup).
- Verify the security headers and CSP from the backend configuration or middleware.
- Do NOT change any core backend business logic for pricing or ride status.

When you are done, show me:
1) A summary of the files you changed.
2) A short bullet list of the security settings you verified or added.
3) A brief explanation of how the new landing page design matches the original safegoglobal.com style but with professional, Uber-like polish.
