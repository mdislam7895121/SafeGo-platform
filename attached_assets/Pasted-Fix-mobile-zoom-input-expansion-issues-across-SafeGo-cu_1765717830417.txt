Fix mobile zoom + input expansion issues across SafeGo customer routes.

Observed problems (must fix):
1) The page can be pinch-zoomed and users can accidentally zoom, breaking layout.
2) On iOS Safari, when typing into address inputs (pickup/dropoff / GooglePlacesInput), the page zooms and the input/layout becomes “bigger”, causing overflow and horizontal scroll.

Scope:
- Apply fixes to /customer and all customer flows: /customer/ride, /customer/eats, /customer/parcel
- Also verify public landing routes: /ride, /food, /parcel

Requirements (do ALL):
A) Viewport + scaling control
1) Ensure the HTML <head> includes a correct viewport meta:
   width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover
2) DO NOT use user-scalable=no as the only “fix”.
   If you choose to disable zoom, justify it and only do it if it doesn’t harm accessibility.
   Preferred: fix the root cause (input font-size + overflow) so zoom is not triggered.

B) Stop iOS input auto-zoom (root cause fix)
1) Ensure ALL text inputs that users type into (including GooglePlacesInput and any address/pickup/dropoff fields) have font-size >= 16px on mobile.
2) Ensure line-height and padding don’t create layout shift when focused.
3) If any component uses transform: scale, remove it for inputs on mobile.
4) Ensure input containers use min-w-0 and w-full to prevent flex overflow.

C) Eliminate horizontal scroll and “layout widening”
1) Add global guards:
   - html, body { width: 100%; overflow-x: hidden; }
   - main containers must not exceed 100vw
2) Find and fix the actual overflowing element(s):
   - Use browser devtools (or code search) to locate any element wider than viewport.
   - Common culprits: fixed widths (px), min-width, long text, map containers, route cards.
3) Ensure all major layout wrappers use:
   - w-full, max-w-full
   - min-w-0 on flex children
   - break-words where needed for long strings

D) Keyboard + safe-area behavior
1) On iOS, when keyboard opens, inputs must remain visible and layout must not jump sideways.
2) If there is any fixed/sticky footer/header, ensure it does not overlap inputs. Add safe-area padding where needed:
   padding-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom)

E) Verification (must provide proof)
1) Demonstrate on mobile widths 390x844 and 360x800:
   - No auto-zoom when focusing or typing in address inputs
   - No horizontal scrolling at any time
   - No layout widening when address suggestions appear
2) Confirm desktop behavior unchanged.
3) Provide the exact files changed and a short explanation for each.
4) Run npm run build and confirm it passes.

Constraints:
- Do not change backend/API logic.
- UI/layout/CSS only.

Deliverable:
- Commit-ready changes with a clear summary of fixes for iOS zoom + overflow.
