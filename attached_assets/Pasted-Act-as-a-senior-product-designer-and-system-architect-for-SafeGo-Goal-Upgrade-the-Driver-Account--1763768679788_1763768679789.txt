Act as a senior product designer and system architect for SafeGo.

Goal: Upgrade the Driver Account Center by reorganizing and expanding the Vehicle Documents section without breaking any existing features.

Follow all SafeGo conventions:
– Four roles: customer, driver, restaurant, admin
– Keep all existing KYC, payouts, referral, opportunity, SafeGo Points, wallet, and onboarding logic intact
– Do not touch ride, food, or parcel flows
– Do not modify Driver Dashboard components
– Do not break any existing URLs, API endpoints, navigation items, or database models
– All changes must be incremental and non-destructive

========================================
1. Move existing pages into Account Settings
========================================
Inside Driver → Account Settings page, add the following three subsections:

A) Driver Requirements
   – Documents
   – Vehicles
   – Tax Info

B) App Preferences
   – Map Settings (rename from Map Theme)
   – Dark Mode

Do not change routing. Only move navigation groups.

========================================
2. Update Map Settings (new rules)
========================================
Map Settings must show three selectable navigation providers:
– Google Maps
– Apple Maps
– Waze

Only one provider can be active at a time.
Persist selection in driver preferences.

========================================
3. Expand Vehicle Documents (Global rules)
========================================
Every vehicle must support uploading the following documents:

1. Vehicle Registration  
   – File upload  
   – Fields: status, expiryDate, lastUpdated  

2. Vehicle Insurance  
   – File upload  
   – Fields: status, expiryDate, lastUpdated  

3. Vehicle Inspection  
   – File upload  
   – Represents DMV/NYS Inspection where applicable  

4. License Plate Number  
   – Text field (not file)  
   – Fields: plateNumber, country, state  
   – Required for all vehicles  

========================================
4. NYC-specific requirements (if driver.market = "NYC_TLC")
========================================

Add an additional required document:

5. TLC License (Diamond)
   – Text input: TLC license number only  
   – Not a file upload  
   – Must show status indicators: pending / approved / rejected  

========================================
5. UI/UX rules (match Uber)
========================================
– White background, left-aligned layout, minimal spacing  
– Grey card containers  
– Document status pills: Pending / Approved / Expiring / Rejected  
– Every document opens to its own detail view (Uber-style)  
– Secure masking for sensitive fields  
– Show “Required for verification” under each item  

========================================
6. Do NOT change anything else
========================================
No impact on:
– Wallet  
– Earnings  
– Online/Offline  
– Trips  
– SafeGo Points logic  
– Refer a Friend  
– Opportunity Bonuses  
– Notifications  
– Driver onboarding progress  

Make all changes safely, incrementally, following SafeGo architecture.

Please proceed.
