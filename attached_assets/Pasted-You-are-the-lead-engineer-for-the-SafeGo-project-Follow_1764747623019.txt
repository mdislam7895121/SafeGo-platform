You are the lead engineer for the SafeGo project.
Follow ALL SafeGo master rules strictly:

1) Core roles (always present)
   - Customer
   - Driver
   - Restaurant Partner
   - Shop Partner
   - Admin (manages all roles from the panel)

2) Global platform logic
   - Ride, food, parcel, and e-shop flows must be internally consistent.
   - Country-aware behavior: BD vs US have different labels and KYC rules.
   - Any feature you touch must be production-ready in one loop (backend + frontend + validation + basic tests).

3) Auth & onboarding rules
   - Customers: simple but secure signup (email + strong password) plus profile completion later.
   - Partners (driver, restaurant, shop, ticket): must become partner THROUGH a separate onboarding flow after logging in as a customer, with proper KYC for BD and appropriate checks for US.
   - No user should ever be “partially” registered or stuck between old and new signup flows.

4) Security rules
   - Strong password validation on both frontend and backend.
   - Rate-limit signup attempts at the API level (existing pattern, don’t invent a new system).
   - Never auto-assign partner roles at signup; role must stay “customer” until explicit onboarding for a partner role.
   - JWT auth and sessions must remain consistent and compatible with existing code.

5) Implementation principle
   - Replace, don’t layer hacks:
     - Old broken signup UIs/routes must be removed or fully disconnected.
     - Only the new customer signup flow should be accessible from the login page.
   - You must test the full flow as a real BD customer from `/login` → `Sign up` → successful login.

------------------------------------------------
TASK: Replace the old “lineup” / signup flow with the new SafeGo customer signup, and ensure the app is actually using it (old flow must not be reachable).

User context:
- Current login page is at `/login` (see screenshot with “Welcome back” and a “Sign up” link).
- The product owner has already defined a new, simpler customer lineup/sign-up design.
- Right now, clicking the Sign up / লাইনআপ link does not seem to show the new flow; it either does nothing or uses the old, complex flow in the background.

Your job is to:

A) FRONTEND – Signup & login UI

1. New customer signup screen
   - Create a single, clean signup page (e.g. route `/signup`), fully localized for BD (Bangla text) but also usable globally.
   - Form fields:
     - Email (required, proper email format)
     - Password (required, strong password rules: minimum length, mix of characters as defined in existing auth logic)
     - Confirm password (must match)
   - Optional fields like full name can be added as non-required, but DO NOT add any partner-specific fields here.
   - Copy and styling must match the new minimal lineup design already discussed with the product owner (simple, mobile-friendly, same visual style as current login).

2. Wire login → signup properly
   - On `/login`, the “Sign up” / “Don’t have an account? Sign up” link MUST navigate to the new `/signup` page.
   - Remove or disable any old routes like `/lineup`, `/register-old`, or any legacy signup pages so that:
     - No navigation points to them
     - They are not accidentally used.

3. Role behavior on signup
   - When this form is submitted successfully:
     - Create a new user with role = `customer` by default.
     - DO NOT attach driver, restaurant, shop, or ticket roles here.
   - After signup, automatically log the user in (if that matches existing logic) or redirect them to `/login` with a clear success message in Bangla/English.

4. Error and validation messages
   - Show inline error messages for:
     - invalid email format
     - weak password
     - password mismatch
     - email already in use
   - Messages must be Bangla-first for BD locale, but keep the code generic enough for US locale to supply English strings.
   - Make sure submit button shows a loading state and is disabled while the request is in progress.

B) BACKEND – Auth & data

1. Registration endpoint
   - Confirm the existing registration endpoint (e.g. `POST /api/auth/register` or similar).
   - Ensure it:
     - Validates email and password securely.
     - Creates a user with:
       - role: `customer`
       - status: active or pending verification (as per existing logic)
       - country inferred from request or defaults, but DO NOT introduce new breaking fields.
   - If there is an older legacy registration endpoint, deprecate it by:
     - Disconnecting any frontend calls to it.
     - Keeping it only if other internal systems still depend on it (but not used by SafeGo web).

2. Duplicate and migration logic
   - Make sure that:
     - If an email already exists, the API returns a clear “email already registered” error.
   - You do NOT need to migrate old signup data now, but you must not break existing users.

C) CLEANUP – Remove old “lineup” flows

1. Code cleanup
   - Search the codebase for:
     - old signup components
     - old “lineup” or multi-role register screens
   - Remove their usage from:
     - routes
     - navigation menus
     - buttons/links
   - It is fine to keep the components in the codebase temporarily if they are referenced elsewhere, but they MUST NOT be reachable from any live route or clickable element.

2. Navigation audit
   - Check:
     - header menus
     - mobile menus
     - any “Create account” or “লাইনআপ” buttons on landing pages
   - All of them must point to the new `/signup` route only.

D) TEST PLAN (you must actually perform these steps)

1. As a brand-new BD customer:
   - Visit `/login`.
   - Click Sign up / লাইনআপ link.
   - Confirm you see the new minimal signup form (not any old, complex multi-role form).
   - Register with a fresh email and strong password.
   - Confirm:
     - You see either automatic login or a clear success message and can log in immediately.
     - Your dashboard behaves like a normal customer, not as any partner.

2. As Admin:
   - Open the Admin panel Users list.
   - Verify the new user appears with:
     - role: customer
     - country: BD (or as determined by the existing logic)
   - Confirm no accidental partner roles are attached.

3. As product owner:
   - Confirm there is no way to reach the old lineup / signup pages from the UI.

E) CONSTRAINTS

- Do NOT change partner onboarding flows (Shop Partner, Ticket Operator, etc.) except where they hooked into old broken signup.
- Do NOT weaken security: password rules and rate limiting must remain strong or be improved.
- Do NOT leave multiple signup experiences active; there should be exactly one customer signup flow for the web app.

When you are done:
- Summarize:
  - which files you changed
  - which routes were updated
  - how the new `/signup` behaves
  - how you verified that the old lineup/signup is no longer reachable.
