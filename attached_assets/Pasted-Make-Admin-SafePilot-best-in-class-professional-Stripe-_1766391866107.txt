Make Admin SafePilot “best-in-class” professional (Stripe/AWS-level) UI + UX.

Non-negotiable UX rules:
1) Chat-first: Default view must be a clean chat window. No grids, no multi-row tabs.
2) One primary action: type + send. Everything else is secondary and hidden.
3) Zero confusion: Remove duplicate controls (Scan/Optimize/Crisis repeated places).
4) Consistent behavior: Every button must either (a) insert a prompt, or (b) send it. Never “do nothing”.

Layout (must implement):
A) Header (single row):
   - SafePilot title + small status dot (Online/Offline)
   - Close X
   - Small gear icon for settings (only)

B) Body:
   - Message list with clear roles (Admin vs SafePilot)
   - Timestamp subtle, not dominant
   - Smooth auto-scroll to newest message

C) Composer (bottom):
   - Text input (multi-line, grows to 3 lines max)
   - Send button
   - Above input: one compact pill label, e.g. “Intel · Normal”
     - Clicking pill opens a small popover to select:
       * Mode: Intel / Context / Chat
       * Priority: Normal / Crisis / History
   - No other visible tabs.

D) Quick Actions:
   - Collapsed by default as a single “Quick actions” text button.
   - Clicking opens a list of 8–12 actions grouped (Support, Fraud, Ops, Finance).
   - Each action must WORK:
     - Click inserts prompt into input
     - Shift+Click (or Auto-send ON) sends immediately

E) Settings (gear):
   - Auto-send toggle
   - Clear chat button
   - Export conversation (copy to clipboard)
   - Model/temperature hidden unless needed; keep minimal.

Quality bar (must pass):
1) First-time admin can use it without instructions.
2) No control is duplicated in multiple places.
3) Mobile + small laptop friendly; no overflow; no tiny unreadable text.
4) Keyboard-first: Enter to send, Shift+Enter new line, Esc closes popovers.
5) Accessibility: focus states, aria-labels for icons, contrast safe.

Implementation scope:
- Only for Admin floating SafePilot widget.
- Support console SafePilot remains separate and unaffected.
- Do not break RBAC or existing API calls.

Deliverables:
- Updated component(s) with clean styling
- Short verification checklist + screenshots
