IMPORTANT – KEEP ONLY THE NEW DESIGN, DO NOT BREAK LOGIC

Global safety rules (must follow BEFORE any change):

1. You are NOT allowed to change:
   - Any backend API route or handler
   - Any database schema or model
   - Any fare, pricing, promo, commission, payout, or dispatch logic
   - Any trip / booking / ride status logic
   - Any URL paths (/customer, /customer/ride, /customer/ride-request, /customer/unified-booking, etc.)

2. You ARE allowed to change ONLY:
   - React / frontend components (JSX/TSX)
   - Layout, styling, CSS, responsive behavior
   - Which components/pages are rendered for each route

If any previous prompt conflicts with these rules, THIS RULE WINS.

--------------------------------
GOAL

Right now, the customer web flow is showing TWO different designs:

- The OLD design (old booking layout / old ride cards / old headers)
- The NEW design (unified-booking layout with SafeGo Ride / SafeGo Eats / SafeGo Parcel tabs, new address capsule and new 3D ride cards)

I want to KEEP ONLY THE NEW DESIGN everywhere and COMPLETELY STOP rendering the old UI, without breaking any logic.

Treat this as a cleanup / unification task.

--------------------------------
STEP 1 – Identify old vs new components

1. Scan the codebase and list all main customer-facing pages:
   - /customer
   - /customer/ride
   - /customer/ride-request
   - /customer/unified-booking
   - Any other customer routes that render booking or ride-selection UIs.

2. For each of these pages, identify:
   - Which components belong to the OLD design  
     (old headers, old booking cards, old mobile layout, old “Choose a ride” sections, etc.)
   - Which components belong to the NEW design  
     (unified booking layout with three-service switcher, SafeGo Ride cards with 3D car images, new address capsule, “Choose your route” layout, etc.)

3. Add short comments in the code for yourself like:
// LEGACY CUSTOMER BOOKING LAYOUT – should be removed from render
// NEW UNIFIED BOOKING LAYOUT – this is the one we keep

Do NOT delete logic, only mark which is legacy vs new.

--------------------------------
STEP 2 – Choose a single primary layout for customers

1. The primary customer experience should use ONLY the NEW unified booking layout, with:
   - Top SafeGo header
   - Service tabs: SafeGo Ride, SafeGo Eats, SafeGo Parcel
   - Address capsule at the top of the map
   - New ride card design and new route selection layout.

2. Decide which route is the main entry for customers:
   - Make `/customer` (or `/customer/unified-booking` if that’s already set) the single, unified main booking page that uses ONLY the new layout.

3. For all other old routes such as:
   - `/customer/ride`
   - `/customer/ride-request`
   - other legacy booking pages

   Do NOT show any old design again. Instead:
   - Either:
       a) Redirect them to the main unified booking page, or  
       b) Render the SAME new unified layout component there.
   - Choose the simplest approach that does NOT break existing links.

--------------------------------
STEP 3 – Stop rendering the old UI

1. For each page that still renders any old UI:
   - Remove the JSX that renders old headers, old cards, old layout, or duplicate address bars.
   - Replace the root UI with the new unified booking component.

2. Do NOT delete the old components from the filesystem yet.
   - Just stop importing and using them in any customer-facing pages.
   - If you keep them, mark them clearly as LEGACY in comments so we know they are unused.

3. Make sure:
   - On laptop/desktop: the customer sees only the new unified booking design.
   - On mobile view: the customer also sees only the new design (no duplicate layouts or mismatched screens).

--------------------------------
STEP 4 – Consistent design across devices

1. Confirm that on both:
   - Desktop width
   - iPhone-sized mobile width

   the same NEW design is used:
   - Same header branding
   - Same address capsule style
   - Same SafeGo Ride / SafeGo Eats / SafeGo Parcel tabs
   - Same 3D vehicle cards and route selection UI

2. Fix any responsive issues where:
   - Old components still appear on mobile
   - Scroll shows an old layout underneath or above the new one
   - Buttons (like “Request ride” or “Choose your route”) are clipped or partially off-screen.

3. Ensure the address capsule does NOT show three different versions across different steps.
   - When the user is:
       a) Entering addresses
       b) Seeing ride prices
       c) Choosing favorite route
     the address bar style must stay consistent and must use the NEW capsule design only.

--------------------------------
STEP 5 – Testing the whole customer flow

Run a full manual test:

1. From `/customer` main page:
   - Enter pickup and dropoff
   - Click “See prices” (or equivalent)
   - Verify:
       - Only the new design appears (no old booking layout).
       - New ride cards are used.
       - Map + routes work as before.

2. Continue to route selection:
   - Verify the address capsule is still the NEW design.
   - Confirm:

       - Routes are shown correctly.
       - “Request ride” button is fully visible and clickable.
       - No old UI flashes for 2 seconds and then disappears.

3. Compare with previous behavior:
   - Prices, promos and commission values must be identical.
   - Any differences in numbers are a bug – fix them by reverting your own UI changes, NOT by changing pricing logic.

--------------------------------
STEP 6 – Clean-up and summary

1. Once you are done:
   - Confirm that NO customer-facing page renders the old UI.
   - Confirm that all customer flows now show only the NEW unified booking design.

2. In your summary back to me:
   - List which files/pages previously used the old design.
   - List which components are now considered LEGACY and unused.
   - Confirm that all tests (desktop + mobile, ride booking end-to-end) passed without logic changes.
