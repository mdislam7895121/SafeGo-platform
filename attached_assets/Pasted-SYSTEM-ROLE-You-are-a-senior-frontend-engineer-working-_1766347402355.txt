SYSTEM ROLE:
You are a senior frontend engineer working on SafeGo Global web app.
Your task is to eliminate ALL 404s for Company/Info pages linked from navigation/footer.
Do NOT change URLs shown in UI. Do NOT remove links.
Use non-breaking, pilot-safe placeholder pages or redirects.

==================================================
TASK TITLE
==================================================
FIX ALL COMPANY PAGES 404 (ABOUT / CONTACT / HELP / CAREERS / ETC.)

==================================================
PROBLEM STATEMENT
==================================================

Multiple "Company" and informational pages linked in the UI return:
"404 Page Not Found – Did you forget to add the page to the router?"

This indicates missing route/page registration.

==================================================
OBJECTIVE
==================================================

1) Identify every route currently linked from:
   - Header navigation
   - Footer navigation
   - Company section links

2) Ensure NONE of those routes return 404.

==================================================
STRICT REQUIREMENTS
==================================================

A) Do NOT remove any links from header/footer.
B) Do NOT change link URLs.
C) Prefer creating placeholder pages over redirects.
D) Placeholders must be minimal, truthful, and pilot-safe.
E) Keep site layout consistent (header/footer, spacing, mobile support).
F) No backend work unless absolutely required.

==================================================
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (MUST FOLLOW)
==================================================

STEP 1 — Audit routes
- Click every Company/Support/Legal link in UI.
- Make a list of routes that 404.
- Output the list in the final report.

STEP 2 — Create placeholder pages (preferred)
For each missing route, create a minimal page:

Standard placeholder template:
- Title (e.g., "About SafeGo")
- Short paragraph (2–4 lines) explaining:
  - what the page is
  - if details are coming soon
- Contact email at bottom (if relevant)
- No promises, no fake claims.

Example copy blocks:
- About: "SafeGo is a multi-service platform. We are currently operating in pilot mode in selected regions."
- Contact: "For support: support@[YOURDOMAIN].com"
- Help/Support: "Help Center is being prepared. For urgent issues contact support."
- Careers: "We are not hiring at the moment. Updates will be posted here."
- Accessibility: "We are improving accessibility. Contact us if you need assistance."
- Community Guidelines: "Users must follow platform safety and respect rules. Full guidelines are being published."

STEP 3 — Redirect only if needed (fallback)
If a route cannot have a page immediately, redirect it to:
- / (home) or /help
But keep it temporary and report it.

==================================================
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
==================================================

- Every linked Company/Support/Legal route loads successfully (no 404).
- Pages are mobile-friendly and consistent.
- No existing routes are renamed or removed.
- No misleading statements.

==================================================
DELIVERABLES
==================================================

1) List of all fixed routes
2) Which ones got pages vs redirects
3) File paths changed/added
