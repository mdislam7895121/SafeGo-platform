Proceed to the next SafeGo Master step.

Implement the full Driver Live Assignment System for ALL three services:
1. Ride-hailing
2. Food Delivery
3. Parcel Delivery

Follow SafeGo Master Rules and do NOT modify any existing schema. Add only where required.

=====================================================
A) WHEN DRIVER IS ONLINE
The driver must enter the global matching pool for all three services:
- ride_pool
- food_pool
- parcel_pool

Start receiving assignment offers from the backend.

=====================================================
B) INCOMING TASK REQUEST SCREEN
You must build a universal task popup for drivers with:

- Service type badge: ride | food | parcel
- Countdown timer (10 seconds)
- Pickup address + map preview
- Dropoff address (ride + parcel)
- Restaurant name + pickup location (food)
- Estimated earnings
- Distance to pickup
- Accept button
- Reject button

If the timer expires → auto-reject.

=====================================================
C) ACCEPT / REJECT LOGIC
On ACCEPT:
- Lock the request
- Update driver_status = "busy"
- Update task record:
    rides / food_orders / deliveries
- Move task to the correct service flow
- Begin navigation screen

On REJECT:
- Driver stays online
- Mark request rejected
- Move to next task

=====================================================
D) STATUS FLOW INTEGRATION
After accept, follow correct SafeGo status flows.

Ride:
requested → accepted → driver_arriving → in_progress → completed

Food:
placed → accepted → preparing → ready_for_pickup → picked_up → on_the_way → delivered

Parcel:
requested → accepted → picked_up → on_the_way → delivered

=====================================================
E) API ROUTES NEEDED (ADD ONLY)
- POST /driver/task/accept
- POST /driver/task/reject
- GET /driver/task/next
- POST /driver/task/update-status
- POST /driver/navigation/update-location

=====================================================
F) UI REQUIREMENTS
Create real-time driver screens:

1. Incoming Task Popup  
2. Navigation to pickup  
3. Navigation to dropoff  
4. Order details (dynamic for ride/food/parcel)

=====================================================
G) SECURITY RULES
- Drivers cannot view customer documents  
- Drivers cannot see other drivers  
- Only admin can modify pricing/commission  
- Must follow country-specific restrictions  

=====================================================
H) COMPLETION RULE
When task is finished:
- Update earning record
- Update commission logic (cash vs online)
- Update wallet negative balance if required
- Driver returns to “available” state

=====================================================
Produce a publish-ready, full implementation.
