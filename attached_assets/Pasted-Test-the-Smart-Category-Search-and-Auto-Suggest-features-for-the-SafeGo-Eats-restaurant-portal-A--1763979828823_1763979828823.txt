Test the Smart Category Search and Auto-Suggest features for the SafeGo Eats restaurant portal.

A. Scope
1. Only test the restaurant role UI:
   - /restaurant/menu
   - /restaurant/menu/new (create item)
   - /restaurant/menu/[id]/edit (edit item)
2. Do NOT change database schema, seed data, or API contracts.
3. Do NOT touch Driver, Customer, or Admin UIs in this task.

B. Functional checks
1. Category dropdown:
   - Main category search works (type part of the name, see filtered list).
   - Subcategories appear grouped under the correct main category.
   - Selecting a subcategory automatically links it to the correct main category.
2. Auto-suggest:
   - When the restaurant types an item name (e.g., "Chicken Burger", "Latte", "Pizza"),
     suggested categories and subcategories appear.
   - Only relevant suggestions are shown (no wrong cuisine or random categories).
   - One-click apply: choosing a suggestion fills both category and subcategory on the form.
3. Validation:
   - Cannot save a menu item without a valid category + subcategory.
   - Error messages are clear on mobile and desktop.
   - Existing items keep their old category mapping after edit and save.

C. UX and responsiveness
1. Mobile (320px+):
   - Dropdown and auto-suggest are fully visible, no cut-off behind keyboard.
   - Scrolling is smooth, no horizontal scroll.
2. Tablet and Desktop:
   - Category and subcategory fields are aligned with other form fields.
   - Long category names wrap nicely without breaking layout.

D. Safety and performance
1. No extra API calls are made while idle; search only fires when the user types.
2. Large category lists (50+ main, 500+ subcategories) remain responsive.
3. No errors or warnings in console or server logs related to the new category system.

E. Final confirmation
After testing, confirm:
1. All three flows work:
   - Create menu item with smart search.
   - Edit existing item and change category.
   - Filter menu items by category.
2. No regressions in other restaurant pages (/restaurant/dashboard, /restaurant/orders, /restaurant/staff).
3. No breaking changes to KYC, RBAC, or payout logic.

If everything passes, mark the Smart Category Search and Auto-Suggest features as PRODUCTION-READY for the restaurant role.
