Goal: Complete R-ENHANCE Task 3 (Full responsive fixes across ALL restaurant pages) for SafeGo Eats Restaurant Portal. Make the entire restaurant web app feel production-ready on laptop, tablet, and mobile, without breaking any existing backend logic or flows.

Context:
- The restaurant portal is already feature-complete for Phases 1–12.
- R-ENHANCE Task 1 (Restaurant Header Redesign) and Task 2 (Unified Placeholder System) are complete.
- Now Task 3 must apply a consistent responsive layout and clean structure across all restaurant pages, including the new planned-feature placeholder views.

Key Requirements (do NOT break anything):
- Keep all existing routes, API calls, RBAC rules, KYC gating, and business logic exactly as they are.
- Changes must be additive, layout-focused, and safe to deploy.
- Use existing design tokens (colors, typography, spacing) where possible instead of inventing a new design system.

1) Global Layout & Breakpoints
- Implement a robust responsive layout framework for all restaurant pages with at least these breakpoints:
  - Desktop: ≥ 1280px
  - Tablet: 768px–1279px
  - Mobile: < 768px
- Ensure:
  - The main layout never overflows off-screen on mobile (no horizontal scroll).
  - Content area has consistent padding on all pages (e.g. 16–24px on mobile, 24–32px on desktop).
  - Typography scales reasonably by breakpoint (no tiny text on mobile, no huge text on desktop).
  - Any fixed widths are replaced with responsive widths (flex, max-width, min-width, percentage).

2) Header Responsive Behavior (rows 1–3)
The current header is a 3-row structure (brand/top bar, restaurant identity row, search row). Make it fully responsive:

Desktop:
- Row 1 (Top Bar):
  - Left: “SafeGo Eats” brand.
  - Right: notifications, language picker (if present), profile avatar/menu.
- Row 2 (Restaurant Identity):
  - Left: restaurant name + verified badge + ID + city/country.
  - Middle/Right: “Accepting Orders” status, online capsule button, any state badges.
- Row 3 (Search):
  - Single full-width search bar with consistent height and padding.

Tablet:
- Compact the header:
  - Top bar remains similar to desktop, but reduce padding and possibly icon sizes.
  - Restaurant identity row may wrap to two lines, but should not overflow off-screen.
  - Search bar still full-width below, but with slightly reduced top/bottom margin.

Mobile:
- Top bar:
  - Left: SafeGo Eats.
  - Right: notifications + profile menu (icons only).
- Restaurant identity:
  - Show restaurant name + verified badge on first line.
  - On second line, show city/country and ID if space permits, otherwise truncate with ellipsis.
- Search bar:
  - Stays full-width, with enough tap area.
- All header content must stack cleanly without overlapping or causing horizontal scrolling.

3) Sidebar / Navigation Responsive Rules
Desktop:
- Maintain current left sidebar with text + icons.
- Ensure active state, hover, and nested sections (Orders, Menu Management, Promotions, Payouts & Finance, Staff Management, Insights & Analytics, Ratings & Reviews, Store Settings, Documents & Compliance, Support) remain consistent.

Tablet:
- Slightly narrow sidebar width, but keep labels visible.
- Ensure that collapsing/expanding sections does not push content off-screen.

Mobile:
- Convert the sidebar into a collapsible/drawer-style navigation:
  - Show a hamburger or “Menu” trigger in the header.
  - When opened, show navigation as a vertical panel with scroll if needed.
- Make sure all main groups remain accessible:
  - Dashboard, Orders (Live, Scheduled, Order History)
  - Menu Management (All Items, Categories, Add New Item, Bulk Actions)
  - Promotions (Campaigns, Coupons & Discounts, Featured Items)
  - Payouts & Finance
  - Staff Management
  - Insights & Analytics
  - Ratings & Reviews
  - Store Settings (Store Profile, Business Hours, Delivery & Pickup, Delivery Zones, Surge Pricing, Staff & Roles, Devices & Printers)
  - Documents & Compliance (Business Documents, Health & Safety, KYC/Verification)
  - Support (Help Center, Contact Support, System Status)
- Avoid double scrollbars and horizontal scrolling on any device.

4) “You’re receiving orders” Online/Offline Capsule Button
Update the restaurant online status control to match this behavior:

Design:
- Capsule-style button (rounded-pill) similar to:
  - Green “Go Online” look when active.
  - Red “Go Offline” look when inactive.
- Left side: power icon.
- Right side: label text.

Desktop:
- When ONLINE:
  - Background: green.
  - Icon: white power symbol.
  - Text: “Online” (white text).
- When OFFLINE:
  - Background: red.
  - Icon: white power symbol (or outline).
  - Text: “Offline” (white text).
- Cursor pointer, hover state with slight brightness change.

Mobile/Tablet:
- Same semantic behavior, but:
  - Slightly smaller height.
  - Ensure full tappable area (min 40–44px height).
- The status must remain in the restaurant header row consistently across all pages.

Logic:
- Reuse existing online/offline state handling; do NOT change backend logic.
- Only update the UI component and any classes/styles around it.
- Use accessible aria-attributes to reflect state change (e.g. aria-pressed).

5) Planned-Feature Placeholder Pages (Store & Documents & Support)
For the following pages:
- Store Settings → Store Profile
- Documents & Compliance → Business Documents
- Documents & Compliance → Health & Safety
- Documents & Compliance → KYC / Verification
- Support → Help Center
- Support → Contact Support
- Support → System Status
- Promotions → Featured Items
- Orders → Scheduled Orders
- Ratings & Reviews → Complaints / Issues

Apply a consistent, professional planned-feature layout:

Structure:
- Center the content in the main panel with max-width (e.g. 720–960px).
- Top: icon in a subtle circle.
- Title (e.g. “Store Profile”, “Business Documents”) in heading style.
- Subtitle: “Manage your restaurant identity, branding, and public details.” or similar – already present from Task 2; reuse and refine text only if needed.
- Status label (e.g. “Planned feature”, “Future release”, “In planning”) with a subtle badge style.
- Section: “What you’ll be able to do here:” followed by a bullet list of 4–6 capabilities (these are already present; ensure bullets and spacing look consistent).
- Remove duplicate “Coming Soon” text where no longer needed, or restyle “Coming Soon” as a subheading instead of a large block if it appears twice.

Responsive rules:
- On desktop: center column with balanced left/right whitespace.
- On tablet: reduce margins but keep everything readable.
- On mobile:
  - Reduce heading size slightly.
  - Stack icon, title, subtitle, badge, and bullets vertically.
  - Ensure bullets wrap nicely and do not overflow.

6) General Layout Cleanup Across Restaurant Pages
- Apply consistent spacing system:
  - Section titles, subtitles, and content blocks should have predictable top/bottom margins.
- Ensure lists, tables, and cards on restaurant pages:
  - Do not overflow horizontally on mobile.
  - Have scrollable containers only when necessary (e.g. wide tables), with clear visual indication.
- Align typography:
  - Heading levels (h1/h2/h3) look consistent across different restaurant pages.
  - Avoid mixed font sizes for similar sections.
- Check these key pages explicitly:
  - Dashboard
  - Orders (Live, Scheduled, Order History)
  - Menu Management (All Items, Categories, Add New Item, Bulk Actions)
  - Promotions (Campaigns, Coupons & Discounts, Featured Items)
  - Payouts & Finance main view
  - Staff Management overview
  - Insights & Analytics main overview
  - Ratings & Reviews section
  - Store Settings section root
  - Documents & Compliance section root
  - Support section root and children

7) Accessibility & Testing
- Ensure buttons and interactive controls meet minimum tap size on mobile.
- Maintain adequate contrast ratios using the existing design tokens.
- Verify keyboard focus does not break with the new layout.
- Add or keep data-testid attributes where they already exist; do not remove test IDs.

8) Acceptance Criteria
- All restaurant pages are usable and visually clean on:
  - Desktop (full browser width),
  - Tablet-sized window,
  - Mobile viewport in the browser dev tools.
- No horizontal scrollbars are introduced.
- The online/offline capsule button works correctly and clearly shows green when online and red when offline.
- All planned-feature pages are consistent in layout, typography, and spacing, and clearly indicate what the feature will do later.
- No backend behavior, routes, or RBAC rules are changed.
- Replit logs should remain free of new runtime errors.

Please:
1) Implement these responsive fixes and layout adjustments as R-ENHANCE Task 3.
2) Update replit.md to document:
   - What was changed for Task 3.
   - Which pages were checked.
   - Any remaining UI enhancements you suggest for later phases.
3) Then restart the app and give me a summary of the completed work and any screenshots you capture.
