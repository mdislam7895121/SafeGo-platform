There is a bug in the SafeGo app related to KYC and ride requests.

Symptoms:
1. When I create a new customer account (for example with my own Gmail address), the customer dashboard shows "Pending verification".
2. However, in the Admin Dashboard → KYC Approvals, there are NO pending verification requests for this new customer (Drivers / Customers / Restaurants tabs are all empty).
3. When I try to request a ride as this customer, the API returns:
   403: {"error": "Customer must be verified to request rides"}

So the customer is stuck in "pending" forever: the admin never sees the KYC request, and the customer never becomes verified.

Your job:
1. Find and fix the backend logic that should create a KYC request (or verification record) when a new user signs up.
   - Check the signup/auth routes (for example server/routes/auth.ts or similar).
   - Check any KYC-related services/helpers and Prisma models (for example prisma/schema.prisma, KYC tables).
   - Make sure that when a new user is created (customer, driver, restaurant), a corresponding pending KYC record is inserted in the database with the correct userId, role, and country.
2. Fix the admin KYC listing endpoint so that it returns ALL pending KYC requests, including newly registered users.
   - Check the admin routes (for example server/routes/admin.ts) and the endpoint used by the Admin Dashboard KYC Approvals page.
   - Remove any incorrect filters (for example wrong country value comparisons like 'US' vs 'us United States') that might hide real users.
3. Ensure that when the admin approves a KYC request:
   - The KYC record is updated to "approved".
   - The corresponding user/profile record is updated so that the customer becomes verified (for example isVerified = true or verificationStatus = 'approved').
4. Make sure the driver/restaurant verification flow continues to work as before and do NOT break existing demo accounts or other roles.
5. Do NOT recreate the whole project or reset the Neon database. Only update the necessary backend files (auth/kyc/admin routes, services, and Prisma schema if needed), and keep all other functionality the same.

After you implement the fix, do this test end-to-end:
1. Register a NEW customer account with a fresh email.
2. Log in as that customer and confirm the profile shows "Pending verification".
3. Log in as admin, open the KYC Approvals page, and confirm the new customer appears there as a pending request.
4. Approve the customer's KYC from the admin panel.
5. Log back in as the customer and:
   - Confirm the profile now shows "Verified" (or equivalent).
   - Request a ride and verify that it succeeds and NO longer returns the 403 "Customer must be verified to request rides" error.
