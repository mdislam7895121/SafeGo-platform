Act as the senior backend architect & product engineer for SafeGo.
Apply all prior system rules, security rules, admin logic, and driver
tier restrictions exactly as documented earlier. DO NOT change any
previously built modules except where explicitly instructed here.

We are now updating and finalizing the SafeGo Driver Tier System.

===============================================================
1. REMOVE DIAMOND TIER COMPLETELY
===============================================================
The Diamond tier is removed. The system must now support only:
- Blue
- Gold
- Premium

Every existing reference to Diamond must be deleted:
- UI
- backend checks
- admin panel
- driver app
- reward screens
- status upgrade flows
- notification triggers

Make sure nothing calls Diamond anymore.

===============================================================
2. NEW TIER THRESHOLDS (STRICT 90-DAY CYCLE)
===============================================================
Update tier thresholds to:

• Blue tier unlocks at: 1000 points  
• Gold tier unlocks at: 1500 points  
• Premium tier unlocks at: 2500 points  

Strict rule:
If a driver ends the 90-day cycle with even 1 point less than the target,
they do NOT get promoted.

Examples:
- 1499 = NOT Gold  
- 2499 = NOT Premium  

Keep separate:
- 90-day status points (tier calculation)
- lifetime points (analytics only)

Remove all old numbers: 500 / 1000 / 2000.

===============================================================
3. TIME-BASED POINT ENGINE (CRITICAL)
===============================================================
Point earning must follow this daily time-slot model:

• 12:00 AM – 8:00 AM → 1 point  
• 8:00 AM – 3:00 PM → 1 point  
• 3:00 PM – 5:00 PM → 3 points  
• 5:00 PM – 12:00 AM → 5 points  

Time-slot logic must be:
- server-validated
- tamper-proof
- device-time manipulation safe

===============================================================
4. NYC RULE: TIER-LOCKED DESTINATION VISIBILITY
===============================================================
This must match Uber-NYC regulation behavior.

Rule:
A driver cannot see rider destination details until they reach GOLD tier.

Meaning:
• Blue drivers → no destination preview  
• Gold drivers → see ETA minutes before accepting  
• Premium drivers → see ETA + traffic condition + higher accuracy  

Also apply:
NYC five boroughs enforced rule:
A driver must complete enough rides INSIDE NYC’s 5 boroughs to qualify.

===============================================================
5. STRICT FRAUD PROTECTION (KEEP EXISTING)
===============================================================
Do NOT change these:
- duplicate driver accounts check
- impossible travel validation
- device integrity checks
- multi-account detection
- GPS spoofing detection
- auto-suspicious-flag engine
- reset logic every 90 days

===============================================================
6. ADMIN PANEL (UNCHANGED)
===============================================================
All admin pages must continue working:
- Tier monitoring
- Manual tier review
- Fraud dashboard
- Manual adjustments (with event logs)
- Payouts
- Wallet
- KYC

Do NOT break any of these pages.

===============================================================
7. DO NOT MODIFY ANY LIVE PRODUCTION MODULES
===============================================================
These must remain untouched:
- Wallets
- Payout system
- Ride matching
- Parcel
- Food
- KYC
- Live chat
- Security Phase 1 & Phase 2
- Driver onboarding flow
- Account Center pages already built

===============================================================
8. FINAL SYSTEM CHECK AFTER UPDATE
===============================================================
After updating tiers:

❏ Ensure:
- Blue = 1000+
- Gold = 1500+
- Premium = 2500+

❏ Ensure NYC rule activates correctly  
❏ Ensure destination visibility shifts only at 1500 points  
❏ Ensure all fraud modules still run  
❏ Ensure admin dashboard shows new tiers  
❏ Ensure no page references Diamond tier  

===============================================================
ALL CHANGES MUST BE BACKWARD-SAFE AND NON-BREAKING.
===============================================================

Deliverables:
- Updated backend tier engine
- Updated point thresholds
- Updated time-slot logic
- Updated NYC visibility rules
- Removed Diamond tier entirely
- Updated UI labels in driver app + web
- Complete regression check
