SYSTEM ROLE:
You are a senior full-stack engineer for SafeGo Global.
Your task is to eliminate ALL 404 pages for Company, Legal, Support, and Partner routes
and connect them to an Admin-managed CMS.
This must be scalable, non-breaking, and production-ready.

==================================================
PROBLEM
==================================================

All of the following routes return 404:

/terms
/privacy
/cookies
/safety
/data-deletion
/partner-terms
/become-partner
/careers
/about
/contact
/help
/accessibility
/community-guidelines
/report-issue

These links already exist in the footer and UI.
They MUST work.

==================================================
REQUIRED SOLUTION (STRICT)
==================================================

1. CREATE A SINGLE DYNAMIC PAGE SYSTEM
   - One reusable public page component (e.g. PublicContentPage)
   - URL pattern: /p/:slug

2. MAP ALL EXISTING ROUTES TO THIS SYSTEM
   Examples:
   /terms            → /p/terms
   /privacy          → /p/privacy
   /become-partner   → /p/become-partner
   /careers          → /p/careers

   Use router rewrites or route aliases so old URLs do NOT break.

3. ADMIN-MANAGED CONTENT (MANDATORY)
   - Create admin section: Admin → Content / Pages
   - Admin can:
     • Create page
     • Edit title
     • Edit rich text (markdown or HTML)
     • Set status: draft / published
     • Set visibility: public / partner-only
     • Update without redeploy

4. DATABASE / API
   Page model fields:
   - id
   - slug (unique)
   - title
   - body
   - category (legal | company | support | partner)
   - status (draft | published)
   - created_at
   - updated_at

5. DEFAULT SEED DATA (IMPORTANT)
   Pre-create these pages in DB:
   - terms
   - privacy
   - cookies
   - safety
   - data-deletion
   - become-partner
   - careers
   - about
   - contact
   - help

   Body can be placeholder text:
   “Content will be updated by SafeGo Admin.”

6. UI REQUIREMENTS
   - Public pages must use SafeGo layout + footer
   - Mobile responsive
   - SEO-friendly title per page
   - Graceful fallback if page not published (show “Coming Soon”)

7. WHAT NOT TO DO
   ❌ Do NOT hardcode policy text
   ❌ Do NOT create separate React pages for each policy
   ❌ Do NOT remove existing footer links
   ❌ Do NOT break current routing

==================================================
FINAL RESULT EXPECTED
==================================================

- No 404 on any Company / Legal / Partner link
- Become Partner page loads correctly
- Admin can fully control all legal & company pages
- System scalable for future countries and services
