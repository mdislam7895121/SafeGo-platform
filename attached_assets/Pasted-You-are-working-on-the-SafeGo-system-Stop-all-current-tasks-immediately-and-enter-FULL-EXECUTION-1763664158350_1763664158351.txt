You are working on the SafeGo system.  
Stop all current tasks immediately and enter FULL-EXECUTION MODE.  
Follow EVERYTHING below exactly, safely, and without asking for permission.

====================================================================
PART 0 — AGENT BEHAVIOR OVERRIDE (FULL-EXECUTION MODE)
====================================================================

From now on:

1. Whenever I give a prompt, you MUST complete the entire task end-to-end with no questions, no permission requests, and no confirmation prompts.
2. Do NOT pause or ask:
   - “Should I continue?”
   - “Do you want me to proceed?”
   - “Is this correct?”
3. If a task has multiple steps, complete ALL steps automatically.
4. If a previous task is unfinished, finish it before starting a new one unless my prompt explicitly overrides it.
5. Never break any SafeGo system rules (KYC, schema stability, RBAC, payouts, commission logic).
6. Avoid ANY destructive changes and stay backward-compatible.
7. If a step is unclear, choose the safest interpretation and complete it without asking.
8. After finishing a task, return a short summary listing:
   - Files changed  
   - Work completed  
   - Any fixes or corrections  
9. DO NOT begin Phase-3 work unless I explicitly say:  
   “Start Phase 3 now.”

Switch to this full autonomous mode now.

====================================================================
PART A — VALIDATE & COMPLETE SECURITY PHASE 2 / PART 2
====================================================================

You must now verify and complete ALL work for Security Phase 2 / Part 2.  
This includes tasks 7–10:

7. Environment Guard  
8. Security Status Indicators (driver, customer, restaurant)  
9. End-to-end security testing  
10. Security documentation update (replit.md)

Required actions:

1. Audit the entire codebase to confirm:
   - Environment Guard exists and works correctly.
   - Security status indicators are implemented correctly for BD + USA users.
   - RBAC restrictions are correct.
   - No sensitive data leaks.
   - Testing covers Phase-2 features.
   - Documentation explains Phase-2 security components.

2. If any part is missing, incomplete, outdated, or incorrect:
   FIX it immediately.

3. Do not modify or break:
   - Trip, ride, food, parcel logic  
   - KYC flows  
   - Commission/payout logic  
   - Wallet settlement  
   - Existing databases  

4. Ensure all changes remain backward-compatible.

====================================================================
PART B — CLEAN & RESET ANY ACCIDENTAL PHASE-3 WORK
====================================================================

If any Phase-3 work was previously generated or partially added—  
such as:

- Fraud detection models  
- AI risk scoring  
- Suspicious pattern engine  
- High-risk dashboard UI  
- New tables or fields created for fraud analysis  
- Alert pipelines  

You must:

1. Safely REMOVE or REVERT that code.  
2. Keep all Phase-1 and Phase-2 work fully intact.  
3. Ensure the repo returns to a clean state where Phase-3 has NOT started.  
4. Do NOT remove audit logs, RBAC, or any Phase-2 logic.

====================================================================
PART C — FINAL CHECK & SUMMARY
====================================================================

After completing all tasks above:

1. Verify the project is now:
   - Phase-1: complete  
   - Phase-2: fully complete (Part-1 + Part-2)  
   - Phase-3: clean slate, not started  

2. Return a final summary listing:
   - What Phase-2 issues were fixed  
   - What Phase-3 elements were removed  
   - Which files were changed  
   - The system’s readiness for Phase-3 start  

Then stop and wait for my next command.

====================================================================

Now begin work immediately in FULL-EXECUTION MODE.
