Upgrade both the CUSTOMER and DRIVER profile experiences to Uber-level quality.

Goals:
- Make profiles the central identity screens for each role.
- Keep all existing backend logic and security intact.
- Do NOT remove or break any current features (rides, food, wallets, payouts, KYC, tax, admin, etc.).

1) Customer Profile (/customer, /customer/profile)

Implement:
- A modern profile header card with:
  - Full name
  - Country flag + city
  - Email with "Verified" badge when KYC is approved
  - Rating and total trip count (use demo data if needed)
  - Small circular avatar (even if placeholder)

- Quick action row under the header:
  - Payment methods
  - Saved places (Home, Work, Favorites)
  - Safety / KYC status
  - Edit profile

- Structured sections:
  - Personal Info (name, phone, email, DOB)
  - Addresses & Saved Places
  - KYC & Verification (status, last reviewed date)
  - Preferences (language, notification preferences – safe defaults)

Make sure everything is mobile-first and matches the existing SafeGo design system.

2) Driver Profile & Onboarding (/driver, /driver/profile, /driver/onboarding)

Backend:
- Fix and complete all driver profile APIs:
  - Register vehicle
  - Upload profile photo
  - Upload vehicle documents (registration, insurance, license)
  - Fetch driver profile with vehicle, documents, stats
- Ensure these APIs are fully wired and no longer return 500 errors.

UI:
- Create an Uber-style driver profile header showing:
  - Driver name, city, country flag
  - Rating and total trips (use demo/demo-mode data)
  - Today / This week earnings summary
  - Online/Offline status toggle

- Add an onboarding progress component with steps:
  1) Personal info
  2) KYC documents
  3) Vehicle added
  4) Vehicle documents
  5) Account approval
  Each step should show a status badge (Pending, Completed, Needs attention).

- Add tabs/sections:
  - Overview: rating, stats, earnings shortcuts, account status
  - Vehicle: current active vehicle details, ability to update/change
  - Documents: license, registration, insurance, profile photo, each with status
  - Payouts shortcut: link to wallet/payouts screen with basic summary
  - Account & Security: change password / contact info (re-use existing screens if present)

General:
- Follow SafeGo security rules and RBAC.
- Respect existing routing and layout components.
- Use defensive coding patterns already used in the project (safeNumber, safeString, etc.).
- Keep everything non-breaking and backward compatible.

When finished:
- Test full flows:
  - New driver completing onboarding (vehicle + documents).
  - Existing driver viewing profile and earnings.
  - Customer viewing and editing profile, saved places, and seeing KYC status.
- Update replit.md with a short "Profile UX Upgrade" section explaining new features.
