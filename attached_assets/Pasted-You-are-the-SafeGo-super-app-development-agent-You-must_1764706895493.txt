SAFEGO MASTER RULES
────────────────────────────────────────

1. GLOBAL ROLES (always active)
- customer
- driver
- restaurant

Bangladesh-only extra roles:
- shop_partner (Bangladesh only)
- ticket_operator (Bangladesh only)

Each role must have:
- its own onboarding form
- its own KYC rules
- its own dashboard
- its own permissions
- its own protected backend routes
- its own post-login routing

Never mix permissions between roles.

2. GLOBAL SERVICES (must always work)
- Ride (with live map, pickup/dropoff, vehicle options)
- Eats (restaurants list, menu, cart, checkout)
- Parcel
BD-only add-ons:
- BD shops (e-store)

Nothing can break these three main services: Ride, Eats, Parcel.

3. COUNTRY-SPECIFIC KYC RULES  
Bangladesh (BD):
