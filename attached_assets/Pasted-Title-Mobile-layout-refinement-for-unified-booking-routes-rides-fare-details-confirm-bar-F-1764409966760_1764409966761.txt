Title: Mobile layout refinement for unified booking (routes + rides + fare details + confirm bar)

Follow all existing SafeGo rules. Do NOT change any backend logic, pricing, routing, commission, promos, or API calls. Only adjust layout/styling/responsiveness for the unified booking experience so that it looks professional on small mobile screens, similar to Uber.

Context:
- Desktop layout of /customer (ride booking) is OK now.
- Mobile layout still looks cramped:
  - Route selection buttons: the right-most option is half-hidden and the 3 cards look misaligned.
  - Ride list and Fare details share the same scroll, so users cannot comfortably see rides + fare breakdown.
  - Confirm button sometimes feels detached or not prominent.
- We want a clear, device-friendly design: same information and logic, but optimized layout for narrow screens.

Your tasks:

1) Create a dedicated mobile layout breakpoint
   - In the unified booking React/TSX files (e.g. `client/src/pages/customer/unified-booking.tsx` or related components), add a responsive breakpoint for small screens:
     - Treat viewports `<= 768px` width as “mobile”.
   - For mobile:
     - Use a single-column content layout.
     - Keep the existing desktop layout unchanged for widths above 768px.

2) Mobile layout structure (top-to-bottom order)
   On mobile, the content should appear in this order:

   1. SafeGo header bar (logo + Ride/Eats/Parcel switcher) – unchanged.
   2. Address capsule:
        - Combined pickup and dropoff card exactly as now (same capsule card, same edit icon).
        - Keep distance/time and “3 routes” row just under the capsule.
   3. Promo banner (if active):
        - SafeGo Everyday Saver green pill banner exactly as implemented.
   4. “Choose your route” section:
        - A title: “Choose your route”.
        - Under it: the 3 route options as compact pills (see next step).
   5. “Choose a ride” section:
        - A title: “Choose a ride”.
        - Under it: vertically scrolling list of ride cards (one per row).
   6. Fare details section:
        - Collapsible card: header row “Fare details” with caret icon.
        - Body shows existing fare breakdown (base fare, time, distance, booking fee, taxes, promo, total).
        - On mobile this card should expand/collapse smoothly.
   7. Confirm bar:
        - Sticky bar at the bottom with the selected ride name and price:
          - Text: `Confirm SafeGo X · $234.68` (for example).
          - Full-width primary button.

3) Route selection buttons – show 3 clean pills
   - For the “Choose your route” area on mobile:

     Layout:
     - Use a horizontal flex container with equal-width route pills.
     - Example styles (you can adapt to the existing design system):

       - Container:
         - `display: flex;`
         - `gap: 8px;`
         - `padding: 0 16px 8px 16px;`
         - `overflow-x: auto;` but try to fit all three within the screen when possible.

       - Each route pill:
         - `flex: 1 1 0;` so that 3 pills share the width equally.
         - Min width around `110–120px` so text fits.
         - Height ~ `56px`.
         - Rounded corners: `9999px` (pill).
         - Border for normal state: `1px solid #E5E7EB`.
         - Background: white for normal, SafeGo blue outline + subtle blue background for selected.
         - Inside layout: route name (e.g. Fastest) bold on top, duration and distance below in smaller gray text.
         - Ensure all three options (Fastest, CT-15 N and CT-8 N, I-684 N …) are **fully visible**, not clipped.

   - For desktop:
     - Keep the existing larger route cards as they are now.
     - The new pill styling should only apply under the mobile breakpoint.

4) Ride list – single column, scrollable area
   - On mobile, “Choose a ride” should be a **single column list**:

     - Container:
       - Place it in its own scrollable area between the route selector and the Fare details section.
       - Example:
         - `max-height: calc(100vh - headerHeight - addressHeight - promoHeight - routeHeight - confirmBarHeight - 32px);`
         - `overflow-y: auto;`
       - The goal: user can scroll through all car options without losing the header, route pills, and confirm bar.

     - Ride card styles:
       - One card per row (full width with side margins, e.g. 12–16px).
       - Keep the existing 3D car image, title (SafeGo X, SafeGo Comfort, etc.), time-away, passenger icons, and price.
       - Keep the “Popular”, “Limited”, “Saver” badges exactly as now.
       - Selected card gets a clear blue border.

5) Fare details – expandable on mobile
   - Under the ride list, keep the existing “Fare details” component but adapt for mobile:

     - Default state: collapsed, only header row visible.
     - Header:
       - Left: icon + “Fare details” text.
       - Right: chevron icon that rotates when expanded.
     - When expanded:
       - Show the full breakdown as you already implemented (Base fare, Time, Distance, Booking fee, Taxes & surcharges, Promo, Total after discount, plus “You save $X.XX” line).
     - Ensure this card is not cut off by the bottom sticky confirm bar.

6) Sticky confirm bar for mobile
   - For mobile view, the confirm button should be always visible at the bottom:

     - Use a container like `.confirm-bar`:
       - `position: sticky;`
       - `bottom: 0;`
       - `left: 0;`
       - `width: 100%;`
       - Background: white with top shadow (e.g. `0 -2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)`).
       - Padding: `12px 16px`.

     - Inside the bar:
       - Full-width primary button.
       - Text pattern: `Confirm <Selected Ride Name> · $<FinalPrice>`.
         - Example: `Confirm SafeGo X · $234.68`.
       - Pull the selected ride name and final price from the same state used in the summary and fare details, so all numbers stay in sync.

   - On desktop:
     - Leave confirm design as already implemented (no sticky bar changes unless you can safely reuse the same component with desktop-specific styling).

7) Promo and traffic logic – keep as is, just fit layout
   - Do not change any promo or pricing logic.
   - Keep:
     - Top green promo banner (“SafeGo Everyday Saver – 15% off your ride”) where it is.
     - “You save $X.XX” text and the strikethrough original price on the selected ride.
     - “Heavy traffic” / “Light traffic on this route” badges and their colors.
   - Just make sure these fit nicely within the mobile ride summary card and are not clipped.

8) Preserve consistency between desktop and mobile
   - Display the **same information** on both desktop and mobile:
     - Same routes, same times, same prices, same promo and savings text, same traffic indicators.
   - Only the layout changes:
     - Desktop: the current 3-column layout with map on the right stays as-is.
     - Mobile: stacked sections, single-column cards, sticky confirm bar.

9) Testing checklist
   - After implementing, run through these scenarios in the preview:
     1. Mobile viewport (e.g. iPhone 14/15 simulation, Pixel 7 etc.):
        - Enter pickup and dropoff.
        - See:
          - Address capsule at the top.
          - Promo banner (when active).
          - 3 route pills fully visible.
          - Single-column ride list scrollable.
          - Fare details expandable.
          - Sticky confirm bar always visible with correct ride name and price.
     2. Switch between routes:
        - Selected route pill updates.
        - Times and distances in the summary and fare details change accordingly.
     3. Switch between car categories:
        - Selected ride highlight moves.
        - Confirm bar text updates to the correct ride name and updated price.
        - “You save $X.XX” and promo details stay consistent.

   - Confirm that:
     - No desktop layout is broken.
     - No backend / routing / pricing logic is modified.
     - Only CSS/layout and minimal JSX structure are changed for responsiveness.

Please implement these mobile layout changes now, keeping the desktop version exactly as it is, and then show me screenshots (or describe) both desktop and a simulated mobile view for the unified booking page (/customer or /customer/unified-booking).
