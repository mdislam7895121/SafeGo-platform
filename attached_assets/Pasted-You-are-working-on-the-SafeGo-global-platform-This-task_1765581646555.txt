You are working on the SafeGo global platform.
This task is to ADD delivery vehicle types (Bike & Motorbike)
for BOTH United States (US) and Bangladesh (BD).

You must follow all existing SafeGo rules.
Do NOT remove, rename, or break any existing features.
Only ADD configurations in a backward-compatible way.

------------------------------------------------
SCOPE
------------------------------------------------
Countries:
- United States (US)
- Bangladesh (BD)

Services affected:
- Food Delivery
- Parcel Delivery

------------------------------------------------
DELIVERY VEHICLES TO ADD (BOTH US & BD)
------------------------------------------------

1. SafeGo Delivery Bike
   - service_type: food, parcel
   - vehicle_class: bike
   - capacity: small parcels / food
   - is_motorized: false

2. SafeGo Delivery Motorbike
   - service_type: food, parcel
   - vehicle_class: motorbike
   - capacity: medium parcels / food
   - is_motorized: true

These vehicles MUST be available in:
- country = "US"
- country = "BD"

------------------------------------------------
IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
------------------------------------------------

1. GLOBAL VEHICLE MASTER
- Add both vehicles to the global vehicle master list/config.
- Each vehicle entry must include:
  - vehicle_key (stable internal id)
  - display_name
  - country (US or BD)
  - service_type (food | parcel)
  - vehicle_class (bike | motorbike)
  - capacity_level (small | medium)
  - is_motorized (true/false)
  - is_enabled (true/false)

2. COUNTRY-BASED LOGIC
- Vehicles must appear ONLY when:
  - country matches (US or BD)
  - pricing is configured
  - driver is available
- Do NOT hide these vehicles in US.
  (Delivery bike & motorbike are intentionally enabled in both countries.)

3. PRICING RULE
- If pricing is missing:
  - vehicle must NOT appear in customer UI
- Pricing logic remains backend-driven.

4. DRIVER ELIGIBILITY
- Delivery Bike:
  - minimal vehicle requirements
- Delivery Motorbike:
  - require valid driving license where applicable
- Do NOT expose any driver documents to customers.

5. UI & UX SAFETY
- Never show blank/white screens.
- If no delivery vehicles are available, show:
  “Delivery is not available in your area right now.”

6. SECURITY & PERMISSIONS
- Only Admin can:
  - enable/disable vehicles
  - set pricing
- Drivers can only select vehicles they are approved for.

7. NON-BREAKING RULE
- Do NOT modify existing APIs, routes, or database fields.
- Only ADD new vehicle configurations.
- Preserve all existing SafeGo functionality.

------------------------------------------------
VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
------------------------------------------------

Confirm the following:
1. Delivery Bike appears in US & BD when pricing exists.
2. Delivery Motorbike appears in US & BD when pricing exists.
3. Vehicles do not appear without pricing.
4. Food & parcel flows work without errors.
5. No Uber naming appears anywhere.
6. App loads without white screens.

------------------------------------------------
DELIVERABLE
------------------------------------------------
Provide a short report:
- Where vehicle definitions were added
- How country filtering works
- Proof that US & BD both show delivery bike & motorbike

Proceed carefully and complete the task end-to-end.
