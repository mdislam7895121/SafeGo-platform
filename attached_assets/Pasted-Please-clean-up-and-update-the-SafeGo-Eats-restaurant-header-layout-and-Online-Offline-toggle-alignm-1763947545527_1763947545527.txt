Please clean up and update the SafeGo Eats restaurant header layout and Online/Offline toggle alignment exactly as follows. Do NOT change any backend logic, routing, API behavior, or KYC gating. This is a pure UI/layout update under full SafeGuard rules.

A. Remove duplicate header
1. Currently the restaurant identity block appears twice:
   - Once inside the main app header/top region
   - Once again as a big title inside the page content (e.g., "mohammad  Verified" with another Online button)
2. Keep ONLY the primary header identity at the top.
3. Remove the secondary “content-level” header that repeats:
   - Restaurant name
   - Verified badge
   - Online/Offline toggle
4. After removal, the page should have:
   - Top header row with restaurant identity + toggle
   - Below that, the main sections (Performance Overview, cards, etc.) without any extra big name heading.

B. Exact header layout structure (desktop & tablet)
Implement this layout for `/restaurant` and all restaurant portal pages:

1. Header container
   - Width: full width of content area
   - Max-width follows existing layout container
   - Padding: 16px top, 16px bottom
   - Layout: `display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: space-between; gap: 16px;`
   - No extra vertical margin that pushes content down too much

2. Left block: Restaurant identity
   - A vertical stack:
     - Line 1: Restaurant name (e.g., "mohammad") in h1/h2 style
     - On the same line: Verified badge + ID / location, as you have now
   - Name font: same as current primary title
   - Keep the ID and location styling unchanged

3. Right block: Online/Offline toggle
   - Use the new redesigned pill toggle (already implemented)
   - Place this block on the RIGHT of the header flex row, but LEFT-aligned inside its own block so it visually lines up with the identity area.
   - IMPORTANT: There should be only ONE toggle in the entire header for each page.

C. Mobile layout behavior (narrow screens)
On small screens (like the screenshots from iPhone):

1. Header container
   - `flex-direction: column;`
   - `align-items: flex-start;`
   - `gap: 8–12px;`
2. Order of elements:
   - First: Restaurant identity (name, verified, location, etc.)
   - Second: Online/Offline pill toggle
3. Toggle alignment:
   - Left-aligned under the restaurant name (not centered)
   - No extra duplicate name, no extra header block below

D. Online/Offline toggle design (keep current redesign, only adjust placement)
Keep all of the following rules already implemented:
1. Size & shape:
   - Height ~46px
   - Pill radius: 9999px
   - Horizontal padding: 20px left/right
   - Min tap target: 44px
2. Icon and label:
   - Icon: 22px
   - Space between icon and text: 12px
   - Font size: 15–16px, medium/semi-bold
3. Colors:
   - ONLINE:
     - Background: #0CCE6B
     - Text: #FFFFFF
     - Icon: #FFFFFF with subtle glow
   - OFFLINE:
     - Background: #E5E7EB
     - Text: #374151
     - Icon: #374151
     - Border: 1px solid #D1D5DB
4. Interaction & accessibility:
   - role="switch"
   - aria-checked reflects state
   - Fully keyboard accessible (Enter + Space)
   - Focus ring: 2px outline, #4B9EFF
   - Smooth 150–200ms transition

E. Spacing after header
1. After the header block, add:
   - Margin-bottom: 16–24px before “Performance Overview” or the first content section.
2. Do NOT re-introduce any second-level “mohammad + Verified + Online” header there.

F. Regression & responsive checks
1. Apply the same header + toggle placement pattern to:
   - /restaurant
   - /restaurant/dashboard
   - /restaurant/orders
   - /restaurant/menu/*
   - /restaurant/staff/*
   - Any other restaurant top-level page that shows the identity block.
2. Confirm:
   - There is only ONE Online/Offline toggle per page.
   - Toggle is:
     - in the header
     - left-aligned with the identity block on mobile
     - aligned in the header row on desktop
   - No layout shift or overlapping elements.
   - No horizontal scroll on any breakpoint.

G. Final confirmation
After implementing:
1. Run through mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints.
2. Take a screenshot of:
   - `/restaurant/dashboard` on mobile
   - `/restaurant/dashboard` on desktop
3. Confirm:
   - No duplicate headers
   - Header looks clean and professional
   - Toggle placement matches the specification above
   - All SafeGuard and KYC gating remain untouched (UI only change).

This task is strictly a visual and layout refinement for the restaurant header and Online/Offline toggle alignment. Do not modify any backend logic or state management.
