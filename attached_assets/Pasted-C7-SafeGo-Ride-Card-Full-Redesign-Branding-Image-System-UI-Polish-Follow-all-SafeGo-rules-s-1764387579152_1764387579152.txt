C7 — SafeGo Ride Card Full Redesign (Branding + Image System + UI Polish)

Follow all SafeGo rules strictly. Do NOT break any backend logic, dispatch, pricing,
commission, promo, or ride request flows.

Your tasks:

1. Apply SafeGo Branding to All Categories
   Change all visible category labels across the rider UI to:

      • SafeGo X
      • SafeGo Comfort
      • SafeGo Comfort XL
      • SafeGo XL
      • SafeGo Black
      • SafeGo Black SUV
      • SafeGo WAV

   Rules:
   • Use bold title text.
   • Title centered above price.
   • Title must NOT wrap to two lines.

2. Professional Price Presentation (Uber Style)
   Update the price section:

   • Current price: bold, large, dark (#000000)
   • Original price (if promo active): small, gray, with strikethrough
   • Savings: “You save $X.XX” in SafeGo green (#16A34A), small but readable
   • Keep spacing tight and balanced
   • Commission logic and pricing logic must remain unchanged

3. Vehicle Image Redesign (Uber Quality)
   Redesign image container for all cards:

   • Image width: ~92% of card width
   • Height trimmed by ~10% for clean ratio
   • Full center alignment (horizontal + vertical)
   • Add Uber-style soft shadow:
        shadow: 0px 4px 14px rgba(0,0,0,0.15)
   • Add subtle white gradient behind the car:
        background: linear-gradient(180deg, #FFFFFF 40%, #F8F8F8 100%)
   • Maintain consistent padding around the car
   • No stretching or distortion

4. Image Angle Consistency
   All images must follow the same visual standard:

   • Side view or ¾ angle (Uber uses this)
   • Slight elevated angle so roof/top is visible
   • White/light background only
   • Same crop ratio for every category
   • Cars must appear identical in scale across all cards

   If existing images differ:
      • Re-crop them
      • Normalize aspect ratio
      • Align bottom wheels horizontally

5. Card Layout Polish (Uber-Grade UI)
   Improve spacing + typography:

   • Card padding: 16px
   • Rounded corners: 14px
   • Border: 1px solid #E5E7EB
   • Shadow: subtle hover shadow on mobile
   • Title font: 600 weight
   • Price font: 700 weight, large
   • Subtext font: 400, small, neutral gray (#6B7280)

6. Badge System Improvements
   Add clean badges:

   • LIMITED (for low availability) → yellow badge
   • Popular (SafeGo X default) → subtle blue badge
   • Promo / Savings → green lightning badge

7. Keep Existing Logic Untouched
   Do NOT modify:

   • fare calculation  
   • promo engine  
   • commission deduction  
   • driver eligibility logic  
   • dispatch matching  
   • route selection  

Only update the UI layer.

8. Mobile + Desktop Consistency
   • Mobile uses horizontal scroll carousel
   • Desktop uses multi-column grid
   • Both must show identical visual design
   • Ensure category selection updates fare summary instantly

Deliverables:
   • Fully redesigned ride cards matching Uber quality
   • Uniform car images
   • SafeGo-branded category names
   • Professional price section with savings
   • Pixel-perfect alignment of all elements
