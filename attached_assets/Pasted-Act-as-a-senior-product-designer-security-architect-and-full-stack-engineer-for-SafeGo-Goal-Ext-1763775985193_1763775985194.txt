Act as a senior product designer, security architect, and full-stack engineer for SafeGo.

Goal: Extend the Driver Account Center → Documents so that:
- Bangladesh drivers must provide NID number + NID image.
- USA drivers must provide Social Security number (SSN) + SSN card image.
- Each driver can only see and manage their own documents.
- NID/SSN numbers are always masked except for last 4 digits.

Follow all existing SafeGo conventions:
- Four roles: customer, driver, restaurant, admin.
- Keep all existing KYC, payouts, trips, vehicles, and wallet logic intact.
- Do NOT touch ride, food, or parcel booking flows.
- Do NOT break any existing URLs, API contracts, or database collections.
- Collections such as drivers, vehicles, documents, payouts, rides, food_orders, deliveries must remain compatible.
- Driver Account Center routes (like /driver/kyc-documents, /driver/account, etc.) must remain unchanged.

Scope:
- Driver web app → Account Settings → Driver Requirements → Documents
- Route: /driver/kyc-documents (do not rename)

High-level UX requirement:
- Inside the Documents page, add a new section for “Identity Documents”.
- The section and fields must respect country rules:
  - Bangladesh: National ID (NID)
  - USA: Social Security Number (SSN)
- The UI must continue to use SafeGo’s minimalist white cards, grey dividers, and left-aligned layout.
- No emojis.

1) New “Identity Documents” section

Add a new card on the /driver/kyc-documents page:

Section title: “Identity Documents”

A) For Bangladesh drivers (country = BD or profile.country = "BD"):
   - Field 1: NID Number
     - Label: “National ID Number (NID)”
     - Input: text field
     - Validation:
       - Accept digits only (with basic length rules consistent with typical NID formats).
       - Show inline error for invalid or too-short values.
     - Masking behavior:
       - When the value is saved and displayed back to the driver, show only the last 4 digits.
       - Example display: “********1234”
   - Field 2: NID Image
     - Label: “NID Image”
     - Helper: “Upload a clear photo of your National ID card”
     - Upload box directly under the label (use the same upload component used for other identity documents).
     - Max size: 5MB or follow current image limits.

B) For USA drivers (country = US or profile.country = "US"):
   - Field 1: Social Security Number
     - Label: “Social Security Number (SSN)”
     - Input: text field with formatting/validation for SSN (###-##-#### or digits only).
     - Masking behavior:
       - When displayed, show only last 4 digits.
       - Example display: “***-**-6789” or “*******6789”.
   - Field 2: Social Security Card Image
     - Label: “SSN Card Image”
     - Helper: “Upload a clear photo of your Social Security card”
     - Upload box directly under the label (same upload component).
     - Max size: 5MB or follow current image limits.

C) Visibility rules:
   - Only show NID fields for Bangladesh drivers.
   - Only show SSN fields for USA drivers.
   - For other countries, hide the entire Identity Documents section, unless we later add rules for them.
   - Use existing country metadata already stored on the driver profile.

2) Security and masking rules (very important)

Backend and frontend must both enforce masking and access control:

- Storage:
  - Store full NID/SSN in a secure, encrypted field (e.g., using existing SafeGo encryption helpers).
  - Never store NID/SSN in plain text logs or analytics.

- API responses:
  - For driver-facing APIs, only return a masked version of NID/SSN (last 4 digits visible).
  - Admin tools may use a separate, secured endpoint if full values are required, but that is outside this scope.
  - Ensure that network responses (JSON) for drivers never contain the full unmasked number.

- Masking logic:
  - Implement a shared utility to mask identity numbers consistently:
    - Input: raw number string.
    - Output: masked string with only last 4 characters visible.
  - Use this utility both on the server and in the UI where needed.

- Access control:
  - A driver can only:
    - View their own NID/SSN (masked) and identity document images.
    - Upload/update/replace/delete their own identity documents.
  - A driver must never be able to see any other driver’s documents or identity numbers.
  - Enforce this with server-side checks:
    - The authenticated driver ID must match the owner of the document record.
    - Reject any cross-driver access with proper authorization errors.

3) Document management capabilities for drivers

For Identity Documents (NID/SSN) and their images:

- Drivers can:
  - Upload if empty.
  - Edit/update the number (with validation).
  - Replace the uploaded image.
  - Delete the image and/or clear the number, IF business rules allow (follow existing KYC logic).
- Add clear actions:
  - “Edit” or inline editable fields for the number.
  - “Replace” and “Remove” actions for the image (if consistent with current document UX).
- After any change:
  - Show a confirmation toast/snackbar.
  - Optionally update document status to “Pending review” if such a workflow exists.

4) Integration with existing KYC flow

- Identity Documents must participate in the KYC completeness check:
  - For Bangladesh drivers: NID Number + NID Image must be present (and valid).
  - For USA drivers: SSN + SSN Card Image must be present (and valid).
- Keep the existing status badges (Pending / Approved / Rejected) logic if already present for other documents.
- If the system has an “Onboarding Progress” or “Driver Requirements” checklist, ensure that:
  - Identity Documents requirement is added and marked as complete only when mandatory fields are satisfied.

5) UI and layout details

- Do not change the existing header, breadcrumbs, or navigation on /driver/kyc-documents.
- Place the new “Identity Documents” card above or below the existing “DMV Driver License” section, whichever is most consistent with the current layout.
- Use the same card spacing, fonts, and input styles as other sections on this page.
- All labels and helper texts should be left-aligned with clear spacing.

6) Testing and safeguards

- Test with:
  - Bangladesh driver profile (country BD).
  - USA driver profile (country US).
  - A third country profile (section must not be shown).
- Verify:
  - Masking of identity numbers in all driver-facing views and API responses.
  - Drivers cannot access or query any other driver’s identity documents by ID or URL.
  - KYC completeness logic works as expected.
  - Existing documents (license, vehicle registration, insurance, etc.) remain unaffected.

Deliverable:
- Updated /driver/kyc-documents page with a new “Identity Documents” section.
- Country-specific NID/SSN fields and images, with full masking and strict access control.
- No broken routes, no changes to ride/payout logic, and full compatibility with existing SafeGo KYC and document systems.
