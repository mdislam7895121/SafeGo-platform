You are working on the SafeGo global platform.  
This task: EXTEND the existing *delivery-driver* onboarding to support a **Car** vehicle option, with proper document rules, without breaking any existing SafeGo behavior.

You MUST follow all SafeGo Master Rules and only make non-breaking, additive changes.

=====================================================
A) SAFEGO MASTER RULES (MUST FOLLOW)
=====================================================

1) Roles (keep separated)
   - Customer
   - Driver
   - Restaurant (Merchant)
   - Admin

   Each role has its own:
   - signup / onboarding flow
   - dashboard
   - permissions
   - status flows
   Never mix sensitive data or permissions between roles.

2) Global services (must remain supported)
   - Ride-hailing
   - Food delivery
   - Parcel delivery

3) Country-specific KYC — branching is mandatory

   BANGLADESH (BD) driver KYC (do NOT remove):
   - father_name
   - date_of_birth
   - present_address
   - permanent_address
   - NID_number
   - NID_front_image
   - NID_back_image
   - emergency_contact_name / phone / relation
   - verification_status
   - is_verified

   UNITED STATES (US) driver KYC (do NOT remove):
   - date_of_birth
   - home_address (US)
   - emergency_contact_name / phone / relation
   - government_id_type
   - government_id_last4
   - driver_license_number (for vehicles that require a license)
   - driver_license_image_front
   - driver_license_image_back
   - driver_license_expiry
   - ssn_last4 (optional)
   - city-specific docs (e.g. TLC license images) when applicable
   - verification_status
   - is_verified

   NYC rule: FHV Number must NOT be required in any UI form.

4) Admin panel (must keep all current capabilities)
   - Approve / reject / block customers, drivers, restaurants
   - Set verification_status, is_verified, rejection_reason
   - Configure pricing, fees, commissions
   - Manage payouts and negative balances

5) Required collections (must remain)
   - rides
   - food_orders
   - deliveries
   Each with:
   - identity fields (customer_id, driver_id, restaurant_id)
   - addresses + geolocation
   - fares, service fees, commission, earnings
   - payment details (method, status, transaction_id)
   - complete status flows
   - ratings + feedback

6) Commission rules (unchanged)
   - Cash ride → driver keeps cash; commission → negative driver wallet.
   - Cash food → restaurant keeps cash; commission → negative restaurant wallet.
   - Online → SafeGo keeps its commission.
   - Admin can settle balances.

7) Security rules (unchanged)
   - Customers cannot see driver documents.
   - Drivers cannot see customer documents.
   - Restaurants cannot see other restaurants.
   - Only Admin can change pricing, commission, verification, blocking.
   - Users can update only their own profile.

8) Onboarding & status flows (unchanged)
   - Multi-step onboarding (basic info, address, ID/KYC, emergency contact).
   - verification_status + is_verified used to gate access to live operations.
   - Ride/Food/Parcel status flows must stay intact.

9) Notifications (must still work)
   - Ride / food / parcel updates.
   - Verification approval / rejection.
   - Admin announcements.

10) NON-BREAKING RULE
   - Do NOT delete or rename any existing DB fields, APIs, or routes.
   - Only ADD new fields, flags, components, and conditional logic.

=====================================================
B) CURRENT STATE (DELIVERY DRIVER START PAGE)
=====================================================

Route: `/partner/delivery-driver/start`

Currently shows vehicle-type cards:
   - Bicycle
   - Motorbike / Scooter

Each card already has text such as:
   - Bicycle → “No driver’s license required. Fastest approval.”
   - Motorbike → “License required.”

Below that, the onboarding steps (Basic Info, Government ID, etc.) are displayed.

=====================================================
C) NEW REQUIREMENT: ADD CAR OPTION FOR DELIVERY DRIVER
=====================================================

You must add a **third vehicle card** for delivery drivers:

1) THIRD CARD: CAR

   Card title:
   - “Car”

   Subtitle / supporting text:
   - “Use your car for deliveries. Car documents required.”

   Badges:
   - “License Required”
   - “More Capacity”

   Behavior:
   - When the user selects this card, we are still in the **delivery-driver** flow, NOT in the ride-share driver flow.

2) SERVICE FLAGS (NON-BREAKING)

   For drivers who start from `/partner/delivery-driver/start`:

   - They are **delivery-first drivers**. By default:
     - can_food_delivery = true
     - can_parcel_delivery = true
     - can_ride = false   // IMPORTANT: they are not ride-share drivers by default

   - This must remain true whether they choose:
     - Bicycle
     - Motorbike / Scooter
     - Car

   - Admin can later enable ride services manually if business rules allow, but this flow should not auto-enable ride-hailing.

=====================================================
D) VEHICLE DOCUMENT RULES BY VEHICLE TYPE (DELIVERY FLOW)
=====================================================

You must update the delivery-driver onboarding documents step to branch on **vehicle_type**.

Assume we already have a `vehicle_type` field for delivery drivers; if not, ADD it.

Allowed values:
   - bicycle
   - motorbike
   - car

1) BICYCLE (USA + BD)
   - No driver license required.
   - No car registration required.
   - No car insurance required.
   - Optional: single photo of bicycle.
   - Keep existing Government ID KYC unchanged.

2) MOTORBIKE / SCOOTER (USA + BD)
   - Requires:
     - driver_license_number + front/back images + expiry (US)
     - appropriate motorbike license docs for BD if already implemented
   - If current implementation already requires bike registration/insurance, keep that.
   - No TLC requirement.

3) CAR (NEW RULES)

   For **BANGLADESH (BD) delivery driver, vehicle_type = car**:
   - Keep identity KYC same as other BD drivers.
   - Vehicle docs (REQUIRED for delivery by car):
     - car_registration_document
     - car_insurance_document
     - fitness / inspection document (if currently used for car ride drivers)
   - NO TLC fields shown for BD (not applicable).

   For **UNITED STATES (US) delivery driver, vehicle_type = car**:
   - Identity KYC stays same as any US driver:
     - government_id_type, government_id_last4
     - date_of_birth, home_address
     - emergency_contact details
   - Vehicle docs (REQUIRED for car delivery):
     - driver_license_number + front/back images + expiry
     - car_registration_document
     - car_insurance_document
     - car_inspection_document (state inspection or similar if applicable)

   - TLC-related fields for NYC:
     - tlc_license_number (optional)
     - tlc_license_front_image (optional)
     - tlc_license_back_image (optional)
     - tlc_vehicle_license_or_decals (optional)

   These TLC items must be VISIBLE IF the driver city/zone is NYC/TLC-enabled, but they must be:
     - clearly **optional**
     - with labels like “Optional for NYC professional drivers”
     - and skippable with a “Skip for now” control.

   There MUST NOT be any blocking validation that forces TLC fields to be filled for car delivery drivers.

   IMPORTANT:
   - FHV Number must NOT appear or be required.
   - TLC fields are optional extras; if filled, they can be stored for future ride-hailing upgrade but not required for basic car delivery.

=====================================================
E) UI/UX REQUIREMENTS
=====================================================

1) Update `/partner/delivery-driver/start`:

   - Add the new Car card visually in the same style as Bicycle and Motorbike.
   - Cards should look something like:
     - Bicycle (selected by default or the first simple option).
     - Motorbike / Scooter.
     - Car.

   - When user taps a card:
     - Highlight that card.
     - Set `vehicle_type` in state.
     - Continue to steps below using this value.

2) On the “Vehicle / Documents” onboarding step:

   - Show different fields based on vehicle_type:
     - bicycle → no license/registration/insurance fields.
     - motorbike → show license + (optional) bike registration/insurance if already used.
     - car → show full car docs (license, registration, insurance, inspection) AND optional TLC.

   - For TLC fields (US, NYC only):
     - Show a small label like “Optional – for NYC TLC drivers”.
     - Add a “Skip TLC details” button/checkbox that lets the user proceed without filling them.

3) Validation:

   - For vehicle_type = car:
     - Enforce required validation on:
       - driver_license_number
       - driver_license_front_image
       - driver_license_back_image
       - driver_license_expiry
       - car_registration_document
       - car_insurance_document
       - car_inspection_document (if business requires)
     - DO NOT enforce TLC fields as required.

   - For bicycle:
     - Ensure none of the car/motorbike fields are falsely required.

   - For motorbike:
     - Enforce only the motorbike-relevant fields.

=====================================================
F) MATCHING & DASHBOARD BEHAVIOR (DELIVERY ONLY)
=====================================================

1) Matching behavior:
   - Delivery drivers with any vehicle_type (bicycle / motorbike / car) should:
     - Receive jobs from `food_orders` and `deliveries`.
     - NOT receive `rides` jobs unless Admin explicitly enables ride services later.

2) Dashboard (delivery driver):

   - Keep the existing rule:
     - Delivery-only drivers should see:
       - Food Deliveries
       - Active Delivery
       - Delivery History
       - Wallet
       - Incentives
       - Trust Score
       - Log Out
     - They should NOT see “Active Trip” or ride-specific items.

   - This new car option does NOT change the menu—only the docs and potential capacity.

=====================================================
G) FILES / MODULES LIKELY TO CHANGE (NON-BREAKING)
=====================================================

Without renaming or deleting anything, you will likely touch:

1) Delivery driver start page:
   - e.g. `apps/web/app/partner/delivery-driver/start/page.tsx`
   - Add “Car” card and wire up vehicle_type = 'car'.

2) Delivery driver onboarding vehicle/documents step:
   - e.g. `apps/web/app/partner/delivery-driver/onboarding/vehicle.tsx`
   - Implement branching UI and validation for bicycle / motorbike / car.
   - Add optional TLC fields for US/NYC.

3) Driver schema / types:
   - e.g. `apps/core/models/driver.ts` or shared `Driver` type
   - Ensure `vehicle_type` supports 'car' in addition to existing values.
   - Ensure TLC fields remain optional.

4) Validation schemas:
   - e.g. `apps/web/lib/validation/driverDeliveryVehicleSchema.ts`
   - Add rules described above for each vehicle_type.
   - TLC fields optional.

5) Matching / service flags:
   - e.g. `apps/backend/services/matching/deliveryMatching.ts`
   - Confirm it uses service flags (can_food_delivery / can_parcel_delivery) and does not depend on vehicle_type for eligibility except where necessary.

All changes MUST be additive and backward-compatible.  
After this task, delivery drivers starting on `/partner/delivery-driver/start` can choose Bicycle, Motorbike, or Car.  
Car delivery drivers will upload proper car documents, TLC fields will be optional (skippable), and the rest of SafeGo flows (rides, food_orders, deliveries, commissions, admin verification) will continue to work unchanged.
