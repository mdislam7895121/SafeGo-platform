You are the SafeGo architect working on step C4 (vehicle category selector for the rider app).

BUG: On the live /customer ride planning page on mobile, the rider still does NOT see any vehicle category selector or car list. The screen only shows:
- pickup & dropoff
- "Estimated fare" block
- route choices (Fastest, etc.)
- "Request ride" button

There is no horizontal vehicle carousel and no list of:
SafeGo X, SafeGo Comfort, Comfort XL, SafeGo XL, SafeGo Black, SafeGo Black SUV, SafeGo WAV.

Even though you say the mobile layout is fixed, the actual mobile UI is still the same as before.

Fix this end-to-end:

1. **Reproduce the bug**
   - Run the app and open the real customer URL (/customer) in a mobile viewport (iPhone size).
   - Go to the “Plan your ride” screen with pickup + destination filled.
   - Verify that no vehicle selector is visible before the “Estimated fare” section.

2. **Inspect the DOM and layout**
   - Open `client/src/pages/rider/ride/options.tsx` (or the equivalent file) and verify exactly where the vehicle selector component is rendered.
   - Confirm that the component (for example `VehicleCategorySelector`, `VehicleCategoryCard`, or similar) is actually mounted for the **customer** flow, not only for some internal test route.
   - Check for any conditional rendering (feature flags, `isDesktop`, `isMobile`, or `isRideTypeEnabled`) that might hide the selector on mobile.

3. **Mobile layout fix**
   - Ensure the vehicle category selector is rendered **above** the "Estimated fare" card and below the route header, as a horizontal scroll carousel on mobile.
   - Verify CSS and layout:
     - The selector must be visible (no `display: none`, `overflow: hidden`, or media query that hides it on small screens).
     - Make sure it uses a full-width container with horizontal scroll for the 7 categories.
   - Keep the current desktop two-column layout unchanged.

4. **Wire up pricing & selection**
   - Each card must show:
     - Category name (SafeGo X, Comfort, Comfort XL, XL, Black, Black SUV, WAV)
     - Per-category price using the existing C2 pricing multipliers.
     - Status/availability badge from C3 (e.g., number of drivers online; “Unavailable” if no eligible drivers).
   - When a rider selects a category:
     - Update the selected state (e.g., `selectedOption`).
     - Pass the correct `rideTypeCode` into the fare calculation hook (`useFareCalculation`) and into the ride request payload.
     - Visually indicate the selected category (highlighted card).

5. **Protect existing logic**
   - Do NOT change TLC rules, cross-state logic, or any regulatory fees (congestion, airport, AVF, BCF, HVRF, state surcharge, long trip, out-of-town, tolls).
   - If no drivers are available for a category, the card should be disabled and clearly marked as unavailable, but the other categories must still be selectable.

6. **Testing**
   - Add or update tests to cover:
     - Vehicle selector renders on mobile for a normal NYC trip.
     - All 7 categories are present in the UI.
     - Selecting a category updates `rideTypeCode` and recalculates fare.
     - Categories with zero drivers are disabled and show an “unavailable” state.
   - Run the tests and ensure they all pass.

7. **Final verification**
   - Restart the app.
   - In the browser, again open `/customer` on a mobile viewport and go to the “Plan your ride” screen.
   - Confirm that the vehicle carousel now appears before the “Estimated fare” block and that selecting different categories actually changes the price and selected type.

When you are done, summarize exactly what was wrong (e.g., wrong route, conditional hiding on mobile, or CSS issue) and confirm that the mobile rider sees all 7 SafeGo vehicle categories and can select between them.
