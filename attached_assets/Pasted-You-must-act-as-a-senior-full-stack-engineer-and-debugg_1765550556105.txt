You must act as a senior full-stack engineer and debugger.

CURRENT PROBLEMS (CONFIRMED):
1) Routes `/shops` and `/food` are loading blank white screens on Preview (mobile & desktop).
2) Build & bundle succeed, but UI does not render content for these routes.
3) Promotion failed due to missing required secret: ENCRYPTION_KEY.
4) Stripe connector cannot be clicked/configured from UI (Configure button inactive).
5) App exits during promotion because of environment validation failure.
6) FCM is in mock mode (this is acceptable for now – do NOT block deploy for FCM).

YOUR TASKS (DO ALL, IN ORDER):

1. ROUTE DEBUGGING (CRITICAL)
- Inspect `/shops` and `/food` routes.
- Verify route registration (React Router / Next routing / Vite routing).
- Check for:
  - Missing default export
  - Suspense without fallback
  - API call blocking render
  - Empty state rendering incorrectly
- Ensure each route renders:
  - Page title
  - Placeholder content (card/list)
  - Clear text like: "Shops loading…" / "Food services coming soon"
- Do NOT leave routes blank even if backend data is missing.

2. ENVIRONMENT FIX (BLOCKING DEPLOY)
- Add safe, production-ready fallback handling for missing ENCRYPTION_KEY.
- If ENCRYPTION_KEY is missing:
  - Log a warning
  - Generate a temporary runtime key ONLY for non-production
  - Do NOT crash the app
- Clearly mark this as temporary in logs.

3. STRIPE CONFIGURATION (IMPORTANT)
- Detect that Stripe connector is NOT configured via Replit UI.
- Gracefully disable Stripe features in UI:
  - Hide payment buttons
  - Show message: "Payments will be enabled soon"
- Do NOT attempt to initialize Stripe if credentials are unavailable.
- Remove hard failure on Stripe init.

4. PROMOTION / DEPLOYMENT
- Ensure app does NOT exit due to:
  - Missing Stripe
  - Missing FCM
- Promotion must succeed with:
  - Core pages visible
  - Routes rendering
  - No fatal runtime errors

5. FINAL CHECK
- Rebuild
- Run Preview
- Confirm:
  - `/`, `/shops`, `/food` render content
  - No white screen
  - No crash loop
- Then report a clear status summary.

RULES:
- Do NOT ask me questions.
- Do NOT suggest UI clicks.
- Fix everything in code.
- Be conservative, production-safe, and explicit.
