READ THIS CAREFULLY. YOU HAVE NOT FIXED THE BUG.

My screenshot STILL shows this behavior:

- After I complete Personal Information and click “Next”:
  - On the Driver License step, the field "Driver License Number" is pre-filled with my name (e.g. "md islam").
  - The "License Expiration Date" is pre-filled with a date (e.g. 12/23/1987).
- I did NOT type those values on the Driver License step.

This proves that:
- Either form state from Personal Info is still being mapped into Driver License, OR
- The driver license fields are still sharing the same "name" as personal info fields, so the browser autofill is treating them as the same.

You said the root cause was `useId()` IDs and that you added explicit IDs.  
**That is not enough.** IDs are only part of the problem. The bug is still present.

Now I need you to do a strict, step-by-step fix.

================================================
0. SAFEGO MASTER RULES (MUST KEEP, DON’T BREAK)
================================================
(Short version, do NOT change any of these.)

1) Roles: customer, driver, restaurant, admin  
   - Separate onboarding, KYC, dashboards, permissions, status flows.  
   - Public signup is customer-only; drivers onboard after login.

2) Services: ride-hailing, food delivery, parcel delivery  
   - Do not break any existing ride/food/parcel flow.

3) Country-specific KYC:
   - BD KYC fields stay intact (father_name, NID, etc).  
   - US driver KYC must keep:
     - date_of_birth, home_address, emergency contacts
     - government_id_type, government_id_last4
     - driver_license_number/state/expiry + images
     - optional ssn_last4
     - TLC fields for NYC zone.
   - Do NOT rename/remove any of these.

4) Admin panel, collections (rides/food_orders/deliveries), commission & payout rules, security rules, status flows, onboarding and notifications all must remain as-is.

All your changes must be additive and NON-BREAKING.

================================================
1. CONFIRM WHICH COMPONENT / ROUTE IS LIVE
================================================

1.1 Open the routing for `/partner/driver/register` (and `?type=ride`).

- Find the EXACT component that is rendered for this path.  
- I want **only the V2 driver onboarding component** to be used here, NOT any legacy V1 component.

If the router still imports something like:

- `legacy/driver-registration-v1.tsx`

then you MUST:

- Stop using the legacy component for this route.
- Route `/partner/driver/register` to the V2 component only.

Do NOT delete legacy code, but DO NOT use it in this route.

================================================
2. REMOVE ANY STATE MAPPING BETWEEN STEPS
================================================

2.1 In the V2 driver onboarding container (the one with tabs: Personal Information → Driver License → Vehicle Details → NYC Compliance):

- Search for ANY code that copies values from Personal Info into Driver License fields, for example:

  - `setValue("driver_license_number", getValues("full_legal_name"))`
  - `setValue("driver_license_expiry", getValues("date_of_birth"))`
  - `setValue("driver_license_state", getValues("home_address.state"))`

or any other combination where driver_license_* fields are assigned from personal info.

2.2 REMOVE all such mappings.

2.3 Check `defaultValues` or `initialValues` for the form:

- For a **NEW** onboarding flow, Driver License fields must start as:

  - `driver_license_number: ""`
  - `driver_license_state: ""`
  - `driver_license_expiry: ""`
  - `driver_license_front_image: null`
  - `driver_license_back_image: null`

Ensure there is no code that sets these from personal info.

2.4 Check any `useEffect` that runs when changing steps:

- If an effect runs on entering the Driver License step and calls `setValue` on driver license fields with values from step 1, remove that part for NEW onboarding.

================================================
3. MAKE FIELD NAMES **DIFFERENT** BETWEEN STEPS
================================================

THIS IS CRITICAL. You fixed IDs, but the browser mainly uses the `name` attribute for autofill.

3.1 Personal Information step:
- Confirm the fields use names like:

  - `name="full_legal_name"`
  - `name="date_of_birth"`
  - `name="home_address.street"`
  - `name="home_address.state"`
  - `name="home_address.zip"`

3.2 Driver License step (V2):
- The fields MUST use different names:

  - `name="driver_license_number"`
  - `name="driver_license_state"`
  - `name="driver_license_expiry"`

Make sure:

- These names are **not** reused anywhere in the Personal Information step.
- These names are the same ones used in the validation schema and payload.

3.3 Also ensure IDs are different:

- Personal info IDs: `personal-full-legal-name`, `personal-date-of-birth`, etc.
- Driver license IDs: `license-number-field`, `license-expiry-field`, `license-state-field`.

But most important: the `name` props MUST be unique and correct.

================================================
4. HARD-DISABLE BROWSER AUTOFILL ON DRIVER LICENSE FIELDS
================================================

4.1 In the Driver License form section:

- Wrap it with:

  `<form autoComplete="off"> ... </form>`

(or equivalent setting in your form component).

4.2 For each Driver License input, set explicit attributes:

- Driver License Number input:

  - `name="driver_license_number"`
  - `id="license-number-field"`
  - `autoComplete="off"`
  - `inputMode="text"`

- License Issuing State select:

  - `name="driver_license_state"`
  - `id="license-state-field"`
  - `autoComplete="off"`

- License Expiration Date input:

  - `name="driver_license_expiry"`
  - `id="license-expiry-field"`
  - `type="date"`
  - `autoComplete="off"`

4.3 If you are using shadcn or a wrapper, confirm these attributes propagate to the **actual HTML `<input>` / `<select>`**.

================================================
5. VALIDATION & “NEXT” BUTTON
================================================

5.1 Validation schema (Zod/Yup) keys must match:

- `driver_license_number`
- `driver_license_state`
- `driver_license_expiry`

5.2 The Controllers / register calls must use those exact names:

- `<Controller name="driver_license_number" ... />`
- `<Controller name="driver_license_state" ... />`
- `<Controller name="driver_license_expiry" ... />`

5.3 The "Next" button must depend on DRIVER LICENSE fields, not personal info:

- It should be enabled when:

  - driver_license_number is non-empty  
  - driver_license_state is selected  
  - driver_license_expiry is set  
  - (and images uploaded, if required)

================================================
6. MANDATORY MANUAL TEST
================================================

After you finish coding:

6.1 Hard refresh the app in the browser (so new JS loads).

6.2 Go to `/partner/driver/register?type=ride`.

6.3 Fill the Personal Information step completely. Click “Next”.

EXPECTED:

- On the Driver License step:
  - Driver License Number input is EMPTY.
  - License Issuing State is EMPTY.
  - License Expiration Date is EMPTY.

If ANY of these is pre-filled, then:

- The bug is NOT fixed.
- You must continue debugging (mapping or names) and NOT claim success.

6.4 Then:

- Manually type a fake license number.
- Select a state.
- Choose an expiration date.
- Upload dummy images if required.
- Confirm:

  - Error messages disappear when fields are valid.
  - The Next button becomes active.
  - Clicking Next moves to the Vehicle Details step.

================================================
7. REPORT CLEARLY
================================================

When you’re truly done, your report MUST include:

1) Which file and function were responsible for the pre-filled License Number and Expiration Date.
2) What state-mapping or name/id issue you found and removed.
3) The final `name` and `id` values for:
   - full_legal_name
   - date_of_birth
   - driver_license_number
   - driver_license_state
   - driver_license_expiry
4) Confirmation that:
   - After Personal Info → Next, all Driver License fields start empty.
   - Only manual user input fills them.
   - Next button works after valid input.
   - All SafeGo rules and flows remain intact.
