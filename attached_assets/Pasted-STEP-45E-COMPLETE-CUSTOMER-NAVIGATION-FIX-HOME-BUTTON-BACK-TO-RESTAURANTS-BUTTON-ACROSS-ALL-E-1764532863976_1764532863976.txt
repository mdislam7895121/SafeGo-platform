STEP 45E – COMPLETE CUSTOMER NAVIGATION FIX  
(HOME BUTTON + BACK TO RESTAURANTS BUTTON ACROSS ALL EATS SCREENS)

You must follow ALL SafeGo Master Rules.  
This is a navigation-only enhancement. No backend/commission/KYC logic may be altered.

========================
SAFEGO MASTER RULES (APPLY, DO NOT BREAK)
========================

- 4 roles: Customer, Driver, Restaurant, Admin — each fully separate.
- 3 services: Ride, Food (Eats), Parcel — all must continue working globally.
- BD KYC: father_name, date_of_birth, present_address, permanent_address, NID number+images, emergency contact, verification_status, is_verified.
- US KYC: date_of_birth, home_address, emergency contact, government_id_type, government_id_last4, (drivers) license+image+expiry, optional ssn_last4, verification_status, is_verified.
- Admin panel: verify users, reject with reason, edit pricing/commission, block/unblock, manage payouts, negative balances.
- Collections: rides, food_orders, deliveries (identity fields, addresses, fees, payment, timestamps, status flows, ratings).
- Status flows MUST remain identical.
- Commission rules MUST remain untouched.
- No redesign of Step 43 desktop Eats layout — only navigation controls may be added.
- All changes MUST be additive and backward-compatible.

========================
A. ROUTE DEFINITIONS (DO NOT MODIFY NAMES)
========================

Customer Home route → `/customer`  
Customer Eats Home (restaurant list + grid layout) → `/customer/food`

These MUST remain the canonical routes.

========================
B. IMPLEMENT TWO GLOBAL NAV BUTTONS
========================

1) **CustomerHomeButton**
   - Always takes customer to `/customer`
   - Label: “Home”
   - Small house icon
   - Must work from:
     - `/customer/food`
     - restaurant detail
     - item detail screen
     - cart
     - checkout
     - order tracking
     - order history
   - Desktop: top-right  
   - Mobile: header bar

2) **BackToRestaurantsButton**
   - Always takes customer to **/customer/food**
   - Label: “Back to restaurants”
   - Icon: arrow-left
   - Must appear on:
     - Restaurant detail page
     - Item detail full screen (if used)
     - Optional on cart (non-breaking)
   - Behavior:
     - This is NOT the Home button
     - It does NOT go to `/customer`
     - It specifically returns to the full restaurant list `/customer/food`

========================
C. WHERE BUTTONS MUST APPEAR
========================

===== 1) On `/customer/food` (Eats Landing) =====
- Keep existing Step-43 grid layout untouched.
- Show “Home” button on top-right → `/customer`.
- DO NOT show BackToRestaurantsButton here.

===== 2) On Restaurant Detail =====
Show BOTH:
- BackToRestaurantsButton → `/customer/food`
- Home button → `/customer`

===== 3) On Item Detail (full page) =====
Show BOTH:
- Back (previous) → restaurant detail  
- BackToRestaurantsButton → `/customer/food`  
- Home button → `/customer`

===== 4) On Cart =====
Show BOTH:
- Back (to restaurant detail)
- Home → `/customer`
(Optional) BackToRestaurantsButton allowed but not required.

===== 5) On Checkout =====
- Show Home → `/customer`
- Show Back → cart
- MUST NOT break Step 44B order creation flow.

===== 6) On Order Tracking =====
- Show Home → `/customer`
- Show Back → order history

========================
D. DO NOT BREAK STEP-43 DESKTOP EATS UI
========================

- “Popular Near You”  
- “Top Rated”  
- Horizontal carousels  
- Cuisine chips + filters  

These must remain EXACTLY as before.

Only add navigation buttons in the header area of each screen.

========================
E. IMPLEMENT REUSABLE COMPONENTS
========================

Create two components (ADD-ONLY):

1) `CustomerHomeButton`
Props:
- label (default “Home”)
- icon (house)
Action:
- Navigate to `/customer`

2) `BackToRestaurantsButton`
Props:
- label (default “Back to restaurants”)
- icon (arrow-left)
Action:
- Navigate to `/customer/food`

Add helper functions:
- getCustomerHomeRoute() → returns `/customer`
- getCustomerEatsHomeRoute() → returns `/customer/food`

========================
F. CONFIGURATION SUPPORT
========================

Add optional config fields:
- showCustomerHomeButton = true
- showBackToRestaurantsButton = true
- customerHomeRoute = "/customer"
- customerEatsHomeRoute = "/customer/food"

Do NOT override defaults unless configured.

========================
G. TEST CASES (MANDATORY)
========================

1) Click Eats → loads `/customer/food` with grid UI.  
2) Click any restaurant → detail opens; “Back to restaurants” works → `/customer/food`.  
3) Item detail → back returns to restaurant; “Back to restaurants” returns to `/customer/food`.  
4) Checkout → Home goes to `/customer`.  
5) Order tracking → Home goes to `/customer`.  
6) Desktop layout remains perfect: no shift, no broken grid.

========================
FINAL REQUIREMENT
========================

Deliver Step 45E so that:

- Customers ALWAYS find a clear way to go back to `/customer` (Home).
- Customers ALWAYS find a clear way to return to `/customer/food` (restaurant list).
- Navigation is intuitive, consistent, and visible on every Eats screen.
- All SafeGo rules stay untouched.
- No existing layout (Step-43) is modified, only enhanced with navigation controls.
