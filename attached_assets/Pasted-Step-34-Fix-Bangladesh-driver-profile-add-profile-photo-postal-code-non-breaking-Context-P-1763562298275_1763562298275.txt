Step 34 – Fix Bangladesh driver profile: add profile photo + postal code (non-breaking)

Context
- Project: SafeGo super-app (rides, food, parcel).
- Admin panel already has:
  - Driver details page with "Bangladesh Identity Information" section.
  - Driver KYC forms for Bangladesh + USA.
  - Document upload system (profile photo, vehicle registration, licenses, etc.).
- For Bangladesh drivers:
  - Identity section on driver details page is missing:
    - Profile photo
    - Postal code
  - In the Document Review modal, postal code is missing and cannot be edited.
  - NID is mandatory; postal code should also be mandatory for new/updated Bangladesh identities.

Goal
Make Bangladesh driver identity fully complete and consistent by:
1) Showing and using a profile photo for Bangladesh drivers.
2) Adding a Postal Code field for Bangladesh drivers (required for new/updated data).
3) Ensuring admin can view and edit postal code where appropriate.
4) Keeping all changes non-breaking and fully backward compatible.

Scope of this step
- Only Bangladesh DRIVER identity and related admin views.
- Do NOT change customer identity or USA driver identity in this step.
- Do NOT change any wallet, trips, parcel, or commission logic.

Detailed requirements

1) Database / Prisma model
- Add a `postalCode` field to the Bangladesh driver identity model if it does not exist yet.
  - Type: string
  - Nullable in schema to avoid breaking existing data.
- No destructive migrations (do not drop or rename existing columns).
- Existing rows without postalCode must continue to work.
- NID remains mandatory as implemented earlier.

2) Backend: Bangladesh driver identity logic
- Update validation for Bangladesh driver identity:
  - When creating or updating Bangladesh driver identity:
    - `postalCode` must be required (non-empty) for new submissions and updates.
    - This requirement applies for:
      - Driver-side KYC submit/update for Bangladesh.
      - Admin-side edit of Bangladesh identity.
- Keep encryption and masking logic for NID exactly as-is; do not change key usage.
- Do NOT expose NID or other sensitive fields outside admin-only APIs.

3) Frontend: Driver KYC form (Bangladesh)
- On the driver KYC screens for Bangladesh:
  - Add a Postal Code field in the address section (e.g., near Post Office / Thana / District):
    - Label: "Postal Code"
    - Input: text field.
    - Validation: required for Bangladesh drivers.
  - If the postal code is missing, the form should show a clear validation error and prevent submit.
- Do not change any USA forms in this step.

4) Frontend: Admin driver details page (Bangladesh)
- On `/admin/drivers/:id` when the driver’s country is Bangladesh:
  - In "Bangladesh Identity Information" section:
    - Show a Profile Photo block:
      - If a profile photo document exists:
        - Show a small thumbnail image.
        - Provide a "View full" link/button to open the full-size image (reuse existing document viewer pattern if available).
      - If missing:
        - Show a small warning text such as "Profile photo not uploaded".
    - Show a Postal Code line in the address area:
      - Example:
        - Post Office: Test PO
        - Postal Code: 1234
        - District: Dhaka
  - The "Edit Profile" modal for Bangladesh identity must:
    - Include an editable "Postal Code" field.
    - Treat Postal Code as required (do not allow save with empty postalCode).
    - Do NOT allow editing NID; keep existing protections.
    - Profile photo is managed via document uploads, not the text form: only display current status, do not add file input here.

5) Frontend: Admin Document Review modal (Bangladesh driver)
- On `/admin/documents` in the Document Review modal for a Bangladesh driver:
  - Under Identity Information:
    - Include `Postal Code` along with Post Office / Thana / District.
  - If postal code is missing, show a clear indicator (for example "Postal Code: Missing") so admin understands the identity is incomplete.
- Do NOT add new editing capabilities in this modal; it is for review only.
  - Editing postalCode continues to be done from the driver details "Edit Profile" modal.

6) Security requirements
- Role-based access control:
  - All new/updated endpoints must continue to be admin-only where appropriate (for admin views).
  - Driver-side endpoints must only allow a driver to update their own Bangladesh identity.
- Input validation:
  - Sanitize postalCode input to avoid script injection.
  - Enforce reasonable length (for example 3–10 characters) server-side.
- Documents and profile photo:
  - Continue using existing secure file upload validation (MIME type checks, size limits, storage rules).
  - Do NOT change any storage buckets/paths or public access rules in this step.
- No logging of full NID or other sensitive identifiers to application logs.

7) Backward compatibility
- All changes must be non-breaking:
  - Existing Bangladesh drivers without postalCode must continue to load.
  - New validation rules apply when:
    - A Bangladesh driver submits/updates their identity.
    - An admin edits Bangladesh identity and clicks Save.
  - Do not fail existing reads due to missing postalCode.
- USA and customer flows must remain fully unchanged by this step.

8) Testing checklist
Please perform and confirm all of these before finishing:

Bangladesh driver flows:
1) Create or update a Bangladesh driver identity from the driver-side KYC form:
   - Submit with empty Postal Code → should show a validation error and block submit.
   - Submit with valid Postal Code → identity should save successfully.
2) Open `/admin/drivers/:id` for a Bangladesh driver with full identity:
   - "Bangladesh Identity Information" shows:
     - Full Name, Father’s Name, Phone.
     - Post Office, Postal Code, Thana, District.
     - Profile Photo thumbnail when uploaded.
   - "Edit Profile" modal:
     - Postal Code field is present and required.
     - Saving with empty postalCode should show an error.
3) Document Review modal (`/admin/documents`):
   - For a Bangladesh driver with postalCode set:
     - Identity Information block displays Postal Code correctly.
   - For a Bangladesh driver with no postalCode (if any legacy data remains):
     - The modal clearly indicates missing Postal Code.
4) Regression checks:
   - USA drivers (including New York/TLC logic) still load correctly.
   - Customer identity pages still behave as before.
   - No errors in server logs related to postalCode.

Documentation
- Update `replit.md`:
  - Document that Bangladesh driver identity now includes Postal Code and profile photo display.
  - Note that postalCode is required for new/updated Bangladesh driver identities but existing data remains supported.
  - Confirm that no security model changes were introduced.

When you are done, please summarize:
- What schema/code files you changed.
- How postalCode and profile photos are handled for Bangladesh drivers.
- Confirmation that no USA/customer/wallet functionality was affected.
