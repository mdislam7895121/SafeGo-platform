Design and implement a fully responsive Promo UI for the SafeGo ride estimate screen, so that it looks excellent on mobile, tablet, and desktop web.

Important:
- Do NOT change any pricing or promo logic.
- Assume the backend already returns:
  {
    finalFare,
    anchorFare,
    originalFare,
    promoType,        // "PROMO_APPLIED" | "SAVER" | "FIRST_RIDE" | "WALLET" | "NONE"
    savedAmount,
    etaMinutes,
    distanceMiles,
    rideType,         // "Saver" | "Standard" | "Comfort" | "XL" | "Premium"
    breakdown: {
      tripFare,
      trafficAdjustment,
      tolls,
      cityFees,
      serviceFee,
      promoDiscount
    },
    routeOptions: [
      {
        id,
        label,        // "Fastest", "Cheapest", "Less traffic", etc.
        etaMinutes,
        distanceMiles,
        finalFare,
        promoType,
        isSelected
      },
      ...
    ]
  }

Your job:
ONLY build the layout, components, and styling so that the Promo UI is production quality on all devices.

1) Layout Requirements

- Mobile (<= 480px):
  - Single-column layout.
  - Order:
    1) Map with route drawn.
    2) Horizontal scrollable list of small route cards (for routeOptions).
    3) Main Promo Fare Card for the selected route.
    4) Fare breakdown accordion.
    5) Primary "Request ride" button full-width at the bottom.

- Tablet (~768–1024px):
  - Either single-column with wider cards OR a simple 2-column layout:
    - Top: map full-width.
    - Bottom: left = routes, right = Promo Fare Card + breakdown.

- Desktop (>= 1280px):
  - Two-column layout:
    - Left panel: map and routeOptions list.
    - Right panel: Promo Panel (fare card + promo info + breakdown + CTA).
  - Use a max-width container and center it; do not stretch content too wide.

2) Promo Fare Card Component

Create a reusable `<PromoFareCard />` with this structure:

- Header row:
  - Left: rideType + ETA (e.g., "Standard · 18–22 min").
  - Right: finalFare in large, bold text (e.g., "$29.50").

- Under the header:
  - anchorFare shown with strikethrough if it is greater than finalFare (e.g., "Was $33.00").
  - "You saved $X.XX" in smaller text using savedAmount.

- Promo badge depending on promoType:
  - PROMO_APPLIED → green pill: "Promo applied"
  - SAVER → amber pill: "Saver"
  - FIRST_RIDE → purple pill: "Welcome ride"
  - WALLET → blue pill: "Wallet bonus"
  - NONE → no badge

- Small reassurance text:
  - “Includes taxes, tolls, and city fees where applicable.”
  - “No surprise charges at the end.”

The component must adapt layout based on screen size (e.g., on desktop put price and promo badge side-by-side; on mobile stack them vertically).

3) Route Options Bar

Implement a `<RouteOptionCard />` for each route in routeOptions:

- Show:
  - label (Fastest, Cheapest, Less traffic, etc.)
  - ETA (e.g., "21 min")
  - Distance (e.g., "8.4 mi")
  - Price (e.g., "$29.50")
  - small promo badge if promoType is not NONE

- On mobile:
  - Display as a horizontal scrollable list (cards with snap behavior if possible).
- On desktop:
  - Display as a vertical list in the left panel under the map.

- When a route is selected:
  - Highlight the card (border, background).
  - Trigger the parent to show that route’s details in the main PromoFareCard.

4) Fare Breakdown UI

Create a `<FareBreakdown />` component that:

- Shows:
  - Trip fare
  - Traffic adjustment (if > 0)
  - Tolls
  - City/airport fees
  - SafeGo service fee
  - Promo discount (if any)
  - Total = finalFare

- Mobile:
  - Use an accordion: collapsed by default with label "View fare details".
- Desktop:
  - Show as an always-visible section under the PromoFareCard with a clean card style.

5) Visual Style

- Use existing design system for colors and typography if available.
- Make sure:
  - finalFare has the strongest visual weight.
  - promo badge colors are consistent and readable.
  - anchorFare is clearly strikethrough but still legible.
  - spacing is generous on desktop, tighter on mobile but not cramped.

- Ensure good contrast for accessibility (no low-contrast gray-on-gray).

6) Technical Choices

- Use the current front-end stack (React + CSS/Tailwind/whatever is already used).
- No inline styles unless necessary; prefer reusable classes.
- Use media queries or the framework’s breakpoint utilities for responsiveness.
- Do not create separate mobile and desktop pages; same components must adapt.

7) No Logic Changes

- Do NOT modify how fares are calculated.
- Do NOT modify any API endpoints or request payloads.
- Only read the existing pricing + promo response and render it in UI.

8) Testing

Test visually at:
- ~390px width (phone)
- ~768px width (tablet)
- ~1440px width (desktop)

Verify:
- Nothing overflows horizontally.
- Text does not overlap.
- Route selection clearly updates the PromoFareCard and breakdown.
- The UI feels professional and Uber-class on both mobile and desktop.

After implementing, ensure the Promo UI looks great across devices and that the main interaction flow (select route → review fare + promo → request ride) is smooth and clear.
