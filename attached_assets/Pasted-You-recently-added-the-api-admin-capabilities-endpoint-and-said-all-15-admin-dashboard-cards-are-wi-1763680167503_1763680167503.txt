You recently added the /api/admin/capabilities endpoint and said all 15 admin dashboard cards are wired with RBAC, but on my side only the 9 core management cards are visible now.

Missing RBAC-protected cards on /admin:
10. Wallets → /admin/wallets (VIEW_WALLETS)
11. Payouts → /admin/payouts (MANAGE_PAYOUTS)
12. Earnings Analytics → /admin/earnings (VIEW_EARNINGS_DASHBOARD)
13. System Monitoring → /admin/monitoring (VIEW_DASHBOARD)
14. Security Threat Center → /admin/security-center (VIEW_DASHBOARD)
15. Support Chat → /admin/support-chat (VIEW_SUPPORT_CONVERSATIONS)

What I see in the UI now:
- Core stats cards (Total Users, Total Drivers, Active Drivers, Customers, Restaurants)
- Driver Statistics cards
- Parcel Delivery Statistics cards
- Management section: Notification Center, KYC Approvals, Document Center, Driver Management, Customer Management, Complaints, Wallet Settlement, Activity Log, Global Settings
- NONE of the 6 RBAC-protected cards above appear anymore on desktop or mobile.

Assume I am logged in as SUPER_ADMIN. I already:
- Logged out and logged back in
- Opened the same /admin URL on laptop and mobile

Please fully debug and FIX this without removing any existing security or financial logic:

1. Call GET /api/admin/capabilities in the running app and show the JSON response.
   - Confirm that the SUPER_ADMIN user actually has:
     VIEW_WALLETS,
     MANAGE_PAYOUTS,
     VIEW_EARNINGS_DASHBOARD,
     VIEW_DASHBOARD,
     VIEW_SUPPORT_CONVERSATIONS.

2. Open client/src/pages/admin/home.tsx:
   - Inspect the adminSections array and any filtering logic that uses capabilities.
   - Verify that each of the 6 missing cards checks the correct permission name (no typos or mismatched strings).

3. Check the RBAC/permissions implementation in the backend:
   - Where are these permissions defined?
   - How are they attached to the SUPER_ADMIN role or seeding logic?
   - Confirm that the same exact strings are returned in /api/admin/capabilities.

4. Verify there is no environment mismatch:
   - Make sure /api/admin/capabilities is called from the same base URL/domain as the /admin page.
   - Ensure there is no old JWT token or different origin breaking the capability check.

5. Check for responsive / mobile UI issues:
   - Confirm there is no CSS or layout logic that hides the financial/security/support cards on smaller screens.

6. Implement the fix:
   - If permission names are wrong, align them on both backend and frontend.
   - If SUPER_ADMIN is missing some permissions, update the role/seed so SUPER_ADMIN gets ALL admin capabilities.
   - Make sure the /api/admin/capabilities response includes all required permissions.

7. Rebuild and restart the app.
   - Then verify on /admin that ALL 15 cards appear again for SUPER_ADMIN on both desktop and mobile.
   - Take a screenshot after the cards are visible.
   - Update replit.md with:
     - root cause
     - exact code changes
     - final list of all 15 cards + their required permissions.

Do NOT remove or downgrade any existing security phases (Steps 40–47) or financial suite logic. Only fix the RBAC/capabilities so the admin dashboard cards display correctly for SUPER_ADMIN.
