C10 — Fix full ride screen layout (map + cards + saver banner)

Goal:
The current ride selection screen looks visually messy because the map,
pickup/dropoff box, promo banner, and ride cards are stacked without proper spacing.
Fix the entire layout to match Uber-level cleanliness.

Do NOT change any backend logic. Only layout and spacing.

TASK BREAKDOWN:

1. Map Section (Top)
   • The map must take a fixed height:
        – Mobile: 38–42% of viewport height
        – Desktop: left column (fixed height ~60vh)
   • Map should never collapse or be hidden behind cards.
   • Add a solid white container behind the pickup/dropoff box
     so it does not blend with the map.
   • Add proper z-index:
       – pickup/dropoff box (z-index 20)
       – map (z-index 1)
       – ride cards (z-index 10, BELOW the address box but ABOVE the background)

2. Promo Banner Section (“SafeGo Everyday Saver”)
   • Place the promo banner BELOW the map, ABOVE the ride cards.
   • Add:
        margin-top: 12px
        padding: 10px 16px
        rounded corners: 12px
        background: #E7FCE5
   • Make sure this banner never overlaps the map or ride cards.

3. Ride Card Carousel Section
   • Add clear vertical spacing:
        margin-top: 12px   (if promo active)
        margin-top: 20px   (if no promo)
   • Each ride card must have:
        – max-width fixed (same size for all)
        – equal padding
        – equal image height
        – no jumping in size when selected
   • Keep the left/right scroll behavior unchanged.

4. Spacing Rules (Make everything breathable)
   Apply globally on the ride screen:
      • Section gap: 16–20px
      • Do NOT allow cards to touch the map
      • Do NOT let promo banner touch cards
      • Ensure consistent padding inside the container

5. Mobile Layout Priority
   Order must always be:
      (1) Map
      (2) Promo Banner (if active)
      (3) Ride Cards
      (4) Fare summary (after a card is tapped)
      (5) Request ride button

6. Desktop Layout Priority
   • Left column: Map + address input + route
   • Right column: All ride cards in a clean multi-column grid

7. No Logic Changes
   Do NOT touch:
      – fare calculation
      – route calculation
      – promo logic
      – commission logic
      – driver matching
   Only fix the UI layout and visual spacing.

Deliverables:
   ✓ Clean Uber-style vertical spacing
   ✓ Map fully visible, not overlapped
   ✓ Promo banner placed correctly
   ✓ Ride cards aligned and evenly spaced
   ✓ No jumping, no overlapping, no squashed layout
