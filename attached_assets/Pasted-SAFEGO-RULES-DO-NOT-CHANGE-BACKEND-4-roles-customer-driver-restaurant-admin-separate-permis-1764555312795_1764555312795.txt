SAFEGO RULES (DO NOT CHANGE BACKEND)
- 4 roles: customer, driver, restaurant, admin (separate permissions).
- 3 services: rides, food_orders, deliveries (ride-hailing, food delivery, parcel).
- BD KYC: father_name, date_of_birth, present_address, permanent_address, NID (number + front/back), emergency_contact, verification_status + is_verified.
- US KYC: date_of_birth, home_address, emergency_contact, government_id_type, government_id_last4, driver_license (number + image + expiry), ssn_last4 (optional), verification_status + is_verified.
- Onboarding: multi step → verification_status="pending" until admin approves.
- Admin panel: approve/reject KYC (with rejection_reason), block/unblock, update pricing/commissions, manage payouts, view driver/restaurant negative balance.
- Collections rides/food_orders/deliveries already exist with IDs, geo, fees+commission, payment_method, timestamps, full status flow, rating+feedback.
- Commission rules, wallets, security rules, status flows, notifications – keep exactly as they are.

This task is ONLY layout change on /driver/map.
Do NOT modify any APIs, DB fields, business logic, or matching logic.

================================================
TASK: Center the "Go Online/Go Offline" button in the MAP AREA (not whole window)
================================================

Problem:
- The center Go Online/Go Offline button was centered using `left: 50%` on the entire viewport.
- Because the driver layout has a left sidebar, the button appears visually too far left.
- We need the button centered relative to the MAP CONTENT area (the right panel), not the whole page.

Goal:
- The power button must be visually in the middle of the map area that starts to the right of the sidebar.
- Left and right floating buttons stay near bottom-left and bottom-right of the map.

Implementation steps:

1) Wrap map and floating buttons in a relative container
   - In client/src/pages/driver/map.tsx (or equivalent), ensure the main map content wrapper (the right side panel) has:
       style / class: `position: relative;`
   - This wrapper should be the parent of:
       • the map component
       • the 3 floating footer buttons (left trip-type, center power, right current-trip).

2) Use ABSOLUTE positioning for the center button inside this wrapper
   - Remove any `position: fixed` used for the center button.
   - Instead, set:
       position: absolute;
       bottom: 16px;      // or existing vertical offset
       left: 50%;
       transform: translateX(-50%);
   - This will center the button inside the map container width (excluding the sidebar).

3) Keep left and right buttons anchored to map corners
   - Left button:
       position: absolute;
       bottom: 16px;
       left: 16px;
   - Right button:
       position: absolute;
       bottom: 16px;
       right: 16px;
   - Do not change their click behavior.

4) Responsive behavior:
   - On mobile (no sidebar), the map container is full width, so the same absolute centering will still work automatically.
   - No extra conditions are needed; just ensure the center button always uses the map wrapper as its positioning context.

5) Do NOT change:
   - Button size, colors (green offline / red online), online/offline toggle logic, or backend calls.
   - Any other part of the driver UI, map engine, KYC logic, or admin systems.

Apply ONLY this positioning fix so that the Go Online/Go Offline button is perfectly centered within the driver map content area.
