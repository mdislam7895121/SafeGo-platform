C8 — SafeGo Mobile Address Bar Redesign (Uber-style)

Follow ALL SafeGo rules. Do NOT change backend logic, fare engine, map engine, dispatch, promo, or routes. Only update the MOBILE UI. Desktop stays unchanged.

GOAL:
Fix the issue of showing address bars on all screens. Implement Uber-style clean address UX for mobile: only ONE screen shows full address inputs, others show compact summary.

TASKS:

1. Screen Logic (Critical)
Implement the following behavior:

A) Screen 1 — Plan Your Ride (First Step)
• This is the ONLY screen where full address input capsules appear.
• Show full Pickup capsule (editable)
• Show full Dropoff capsule (editable)
• Medium-thick balanced capsule style (not too fat, not too thin)
• Rounded corners (full pill)
• Icons: swap, clear, pin

B) Screen 2 — Choose Your Ride
• REMOVE full address input fields.
• Show ONE compact Address Summary Capsule:
    - Pickup + Dropoff in two lines
    - Blue dot (pickup), red dot (dropoff)
    - Right-side Edit icon
• Tapping Edit returns to Screen 1 (Plan Your Ride)
• Capsule stays fixed at top (not scrollable)

C) Screen 3 — Choose Your Route (Favorite route selector)
• DO NOT show full address bars.
• Show the SAME compact Address Summary Capsule used in Screen 2.
• Capsule fixed above route options.
• User can scroll map and route list freely.
• “Back to ride details” returns to Screen 2.

This must eliminate triple address duplication.

2. Capsule Design Requirements
• Medium-thick capsule height
• Full pill radius
• Soft shadow: 0 2px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)
• Clean vertical spacing
• Icons perfectly center-aligned
• Text must be 15px–16px weight: 500

3. Expand / Collapse Interaction (Mobile Only)
• Compact summary capsule collapses by default
• Add right-side chevron (›)
• When tapped:
    - Capsule smoothly expands showing 2–3 lines of each address
• Tapping again collapses
• This must NOT show full input bars. Full inputs appear ONLY on Screen 1.

4. Cleanup Rules
• Remove address fields from Choose Your Ride screen
• Remove address fields from Choose Your Route screen
• Request Ride button must always stay visible
• Map may never be hidden by unnecessary UI
• Do not break scroll behavior

5. Behavior Rules
• Editing address forces user back to Screen 1
• Plan → Ride → Route flow must stay clean
• All backend functionality must remain untouched
• Desktop version must not change

DELIVERABLES:
• Fully updated mobile UI for all three screens
• Full inputs only on Screen 1
• Compact summary on Screen 2 and Screen 3
• Smooth expand/collapse capsule
• Clean Uber-style mobile layout
• All logic preserved
