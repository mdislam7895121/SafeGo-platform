You are the SafeGo platform code agent. Follow all existing SafeGo master rules:

- Four core roles: customer, driver, restaurant, admin.
- Multi-service platform: rides, food, parcel — with shared wallet, payouts, and support.
- Country-specific KYC: Bangladesh (NID/passport, mobile wallet), USA (SSN/EIN + bank account).
- Security: KYC + RBAC gating, audit logging, no public unsafe endpoints, no breaking DB/schema changes, encrypted sensitive data.
- Unified payout system is already FROZEN for individual withdrawals. Do NOT change payout models, tables, or business rules.

Context:
- The Driver Performance & Ratings Dashboard (D18) and Driver Incentives & Milestones Center (D19) are implemented and architect-verified.
- On the `/driver/performance` page the UI currently shows: "Unable to load performance data. Please try again later."
- This is happening because there is no real trip/earnings/rating data for the demo driver account in the database.

Goal:
Make the driver performance and incentives dashboards fully usable in the current Replit environment by seeding realistic DEMO data for one or more drivers — WITHOUT changing any schemas or breaking production rules.

High-level requirements:
1. Do NOT modify database schemas, existing models, or payout logic.
2. Do NOT change any production business rules for payouts, KYC, or RBAC.
3. Implement a safe, repeatable DEMO DATA seeding mechanism that:
   - Only runs in non-production (Replit dev) environment.
   - Can be easily disabled or removed later.
   - Does not interfere with real data once the platform goes live.

Detailed implementation plan:

1) Inspect existing driver performance dependencies
- Find the backend service(s) and endpoints used by `/driver/performance` and related driver analytics, for example:
  - DriverPerformanceService (or similar)
  - Trip/Ride models and queries
  - Earnings/Wallet models used for driver stats
  - Any rating/review models referenced in D18 and D19
- Confirm exactly which collections/tables and fields are read for:
  - Total completed trips
  - Cancelled trips
  - Distances / durations
  - Earnings per trip and total earnings
  - Average rating and rating breakdown
  - Incentive/milestone progress (if applicable)

2) Create a non-production demo data seeding script
- Add a new script file in a suitable location, for example:
  - `server/scripts/seedDriverDemoData.ts`
- This script must:
  - Check an environment guard such as `NODE_ENV !== "production"` or a dedicated flag like `SAFEGO_DEMO_SEED=true`.
  - Query for one or two existing VERIFIED driver profiles:
    - isVerified === true
    - verificationStatus === "APPROVED"
  - If no verified drivers exist, create a single DEMO driver with clearly marked fields, e.g.:
    - name: "Demo Driver"
    - email/phone marked as demo
    - proper KYC flags set to satisfy RBAC checks, but still clearly non-real.

3) Seed realistic trip and earnings data
- For the selected demo driver(s), insert a realistic set of trips, for example:
  - 30–60 trips over the past 30 days
  - Mix of ride types (short, medium, long) consistent with the existing schema.
  - Reasonable fields: timestamps, pickup/dropoff locations (cities/areas only, no sensitive real addresses), distance, duration, fare, commission, net earnings.
  - Include at least a few cancelled or failed trips if the performance dashboard uses them.
- Ensure all inserted trips:
  - Fully match the existing Trip/Ride schema (no new fields).
  - Correctly reference driver ID, customer ID (dummy/test customers), and any order IDs if required.
- For earnings:
  - Make sure the seeded trips correctly feed into whatever aggregate queries the performance dashboard uses.
  - If there is a separate earnings or driver-earning model, insert matching rows so totals and graphs look consistent with the trips.

4) Seed ratings and incentives data
- If the performance dashboard or D19 incentives depend on ratings:
  - Insert realistic rating records (4.7–4.9 average) with:
    - rating value (1–5)
    - comment text (short generic demo comments)
    - timestamps linked to trips where possible.
- If incentives/milestones use separate models:
  - Seed progress entries so the D19 Incentives & Milestones Center shows:
    - At least one completed milestone
    - At least one in-progress incentive
    - Zero critical errors in the UI.

5) Integrate seeding into development workflow
- Make sure running the script is straightforward:
  - Add an npm script in `package.json`, e.g. `"seed:driver-demo": "ts-node server/scripts/seedDriverDemoData.ts"` or equivalent for this codebase.
- Do NOT run seeding automatically on every app start.
  - Instead, clearly document in `replit.md` how to run:
    - `npm run seed:driver-demo`
- Ensure the script is idempotent:
  - If it runs multiple times, it should either:
    - Detect existing demo trips and not duplicate them, OR
    - Safely reset DEMO data for the selected demo driver(s) before inserting fresh records.

6) Preserve KYC, RBAC, and audit logging
- All seeded trips/earnings must respect:
  - Driver must pass the same KYC/RBAC checks used by the performance endpoints.
  - Existing audit logging should record created rows if logging is triggered through normal services.
- Do NOT create any new public debug endpoints.
  - The seeding should be done via the script or an admin-only internal method.
- Confirm that:
  - `/driver/performance`
  - Any linked pages (earnings breakdown, incentives, ratings view)
  now load successfully for the demo driver account once the script has been run and the driver is logged in.

7) Verification & tests
- After implementing the script:
  - Run the database seeding in the Replit environment.
  - Log in as the demo driver used for seeding.
  - Visit `/driver/performance` and confirm:
    - No more "Unable to load performance data" error.
    - All charts, metrics, and breakdown components render with realistic values.
  - Visit any related pages (e.g. incentives/ratings) and confirm they also behave correctly.
- If there are existing unit/integration tests touching driver performance:
  - Ensure they still pass and are not affected by the seeding script (tests should not rely on demo data unless explicitly configured to do so).

8) Documentation update
- Update `replit.md` with a short "Driver Demo Data" section:
  - Purpose: to visualize the driver performance and incentives dashboards in dev.
  - How to run: command to execute the seed script.
  - Environment note: clearly state that this is for non-production environments only, and should not be enabled in live deployments.

Strict constraints:
- Do NOT alter payout models, payout routes, or unified payout logic (it is frozen by design).
- Do NOT relax KYC or RBAC checks.
- Do NOT introduce any new public endpoints accessible to customers, drivers, or restaurants.
- Do NOT introduce breaking changes to existing API contracts.

Once complete, give me:
- A summary of what was seeded (number of trips, date range, driver used).
- Confirmation that `/driver/performance` and related dashboards now load without errors for the demo driver.
- Any commands I need to run in Replit to reseed or reset the demo data.
