You are building an operations-grade admin feature for SafeGo.

Follow SafeGo’s existing architecture:
- Node/TypeScript backend with Prisma (or equivalent).
- Admin console with RBAC, JWT, and audit logs.
- Rides, Eats, Shop, and Ticket/Rental flows running on the same platform.

TASK GOAL  
Implement an **Operations Console** inside the admin panel where ops admins can see:
- scheduled jobs / cron tasks
- service health checks
- critical backend errors and third-party integration issues

REQUIREMENTS  

1. Job & Task Monitoring
   - Identify recurring backend jobs (examples):
     - payout processing
     - wallet reconciliation
     - Stripe sync or payment provider sync
     - notification cleanups
     - analytics aggregation
   - Create a `SystemJobRun` model/table logging:
     - id, jobName, startedAt, finishedAt, status (SUCCESS, FAILED, PARTIAL), durationMs, errorSummary, environment (dev/staging/prod).
   - Wrap existing job runners to automatically insert/update logs.

2. Health Check Endpoints
   - Implement a structured health check endpoint:
     - `/api/admin/health` returning:
       - database connectivity
       - external services (payment gateway, SMS/email providers, map/location provider)
       - queue / background worker status
     - Use clear status fields (OK, DEGRADED, DOWN) with latency metrics.

3. Error & Alert View
   - Integrate with existing logging (or add a lightweight error log table) for:
     - recent critical errors (5xx, payment failures, KYC provider issues).
   - Store: timestamp, service, severity, message, correlationId, userId (if any), country, environment.
   - Create endpoint(s) for paginated fetching with filters (date, severity, service, country).

4. Operations Console UI
   - New sidebar section “Operations” with sub-pages:
     - “Jobs & Schedules”
     - “Health & Dependencies”
     - “Error Monitor”
   - Jobs page:
     - Table of last N runs per job with sparkline or simple success/failure history.
     - Indicators if a job hasn’t run on schedule.
   - Health page:
     - Simple cards (DB, Payments, Notifications, Maps, Queue) with status (green/amber/red) and last check time.
   - Error page:
     - Filterable list of critical errors with quick search and link to related entities (user, trip, order) when available.

5. Permissions & Security
   - Only `OPS_ADMIN`, `TECH_ADMIN`, or `SUPER_ADMIN` roles can access the Operations section.
   - All access should be logged in audit logs (who viewed what page and when).

6. Tests & Validation
   - Include sanity checks to make sure:
     - Jobs records are created and updated correctly.
     - Health endpoint handles failures gracefully and never leaks secrets.
     - Error views paginate correctly.

Deliver fully working backend and UI so the operations team can monitor SafeGo reliability from one place without needing external tools.
