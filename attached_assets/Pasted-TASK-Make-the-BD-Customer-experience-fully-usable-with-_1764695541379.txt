TASK: Make the BD Customer experience fully usable with DEMO data for
Tickets, Rentals, and Shops immediately after signup + login.

Goal:
- A brand new BD customer account (role=customer, countryCode="BD") should:
  1) See tabs/entry points for:
     - BD Tickets
     - BD Rentals
     - BD Shops
  2) See demo data (example tickets, rentals, shops + products) even if
     there are no real operators yet.
  3) Be able to complete a full demo flow:
     - Search → select → book ticket
     - Choose rental vehicle → submit rental request
     - Open shop → add item to cart → place order
  4) All demo actions must respect SafeGo rules and use additive collections.

====================================================
1) CUSTOMER NAVIGATION (BD ONLY)
====================================================

Update the customer navigation so that:

- For countryCode="BD", role="customer":
  - The main customer screen (currently Ride/Eats/Parcel) must also show
    clear entry points for BD services:
    * "BD Tickets" (bus tickets)
    * "BD Rentals" (car rentals)
    * "BD Shops" (local e-store)

- This can be:
  - either new tiles/cards on the customer home screen, or
  - an additional "Bangladesh" tab that shows these three options.

- For countryCode!="BD" (e.g., US):
  - These BD-specific entries must be completely hidden.

Routing:
- BD Tickets → /bd/ticket-search   (existing)
- BD Rentals → /customer/bd-rentals
- BD Shops   → /customer/bd-shops

Make sure:
- Only customer role can reach these URLs.
- If a non-customer tries, redirect to their own dashboard or login.

====================================================
2) DEMO SEEDING – BD TICKETS
====================================================

Use the existing ticket_operator backend but add DEMO data support.

2.1 Demo operator:
- Create a special demo Ticket Operator for BD:
  - operator_id = DEMO_TICKET_OPERATOR_BD (or similar)
  - marked with is_demo = true
  - countryCode="BD"

2.2 Demo routes:
- Seed at least 6–10 popular routes, e.g.:
  - ঢাকা ↔ চট্টগ্রাম
  - ঢাকা ↔ সিলেট
  - ঢাকা ↔ রাজশাহী
  - ঢাকা ↔ রংপুর
  - ঢাকা ↔ কক্সবাজার
- Every route must be TWO-WAY:
  - ঢাকার দিক থেকে → গন্তব্য
  - গন্তব্য থেকে → ঢাকা

- Each route must include:
  - route_id
  - from_city, to_city
  - operator_id (demo operator)
  - bus_name (e.g., "Shohag Paribahan", "Green Line")
  - bus_type (AC, Non-AC, Sleeper, etc.)
  - departure_times (list)
  - base_fare
  - seat_layout reference (already implemented)

2.3 Customer search (BD tickets):
- If a BD customer searches any of these demo routes:
  - show matching demo trips immediately.
- If real operators exist for the same route:
  - show real operators first, then demo as fallback.

2.4 Demo booking:
- When a BD customer completes a ticket booking on demo operator:
  - create a "ticket_booking" record marked demo=true
  - do NOT affect real operator wallet
  - still follow status flow:
    requested → confirmed → completed/cancelled_demo

- This must not touch rides/food_orders/deliveries collections.

====================================================
3) DEMO SEEDING – BD RENTALS
====================================================

3.1 Demo rental vehicles:
- Create a minimal rental_vehicles collection if it does not exist yet
  (add-only, no breaking).
  Fields:
  - id
  - operator_id (link to demo ticket_operator or dedicated demo rental operator)
  - country_code ("BD")
  - city ("Dhaka")
  - vehicle_type (car, microbus, SUV, tourist_bus, bike)
  - name/model
  - seats
  - base_price_per_day
  - base_price_per_hour (optional)
  - image_url
  - is_available (default true)
  - is_demo (true for demo vehicles)
  - created_at, updated_at

- Seed at least:
  - 3 demo cars
  - 2 demo microbuses
  - 1 demo SUV
  - 1 demo tourist bus

3.2 Customer rentals page (/customer/bd-rentals):
- Below the search + filter chips, show a scrollable list of cards.

Rental card:
- vehicle image
- name/model (Bangla-friendly title)
- type badge (কার / মাইক্রো / এসইউভি / ট্যুরিস্ট বাস / বাইক)
- seats
- price summary: "প্রতি দিন শুরু ২,৫০০ টাকা থেকে"
- CTA: "বিস্তারিত দেখুন"

On card tap:
- open rental details page (new route):
  /customer/bd-rentals/[id]
- show:
  - full image
  - description
  - pricing (per day/hour)
  - pickup area in Bangla
  - "রিকোয়েস্ট পাঠান" button

3.3 Demo rental booking:
- Submitting a rental request should:
  - create a rental_booking record with:
    * customer_id
    * rental_vehicle_id
    * start_date, end_date (or approximate)
    * status flow:
      requested → confirmed_demo → completed_demo OR cancelled_demo
    * is_demo = true
  - Display success screen with Bangla text:
    "ডেমো বুকিং সফল হয়েছে – এটি শুধু পরীক্ষা করার জন্য।"

- No impact on rides, food_orders, or deliveries collection.

====================================================
4) DEMO SEEDING – BD SHOPS
====================================================

4.1 Demo shop partners:
- Create 3–5 demo shop_partner records for BD if none exist:
  - Example categories:
    * মুদি দোকান
    * মোবাইল দোকান
    * কসমেটিকস
    * স্টেশনারি
  - Each shop:
    - has countryCode="BD"
    - is_demo = true
    - location in Dhaka

4.2 Demo products:
- For each demo shop, seed 10–20 products with minimal fields:
  - id
  - shop_id
  - name (Bangla)
  - price
  - image_url (placeholder OK)
  - category
  - is_available
  - is_demo = true

4.3 Customer shops page (/customer/bd-shops):
- Replace permanent “no shops” empty state.
- Fetch shops from BD API (existing or new: GET /api/bd/shops).
- If there are no real shops:
  - return demo shops.
- Display cards:
  - shop logo
  - shop name (Bangla)
  - category tag
  - approximate delivery time (e.g., "৩০–৪৫ মিনিট")
  - "দোকান খুলুন" CTA.

On card tap:
- Navigate to existing shop storefront route for that shop_partner.
- Show product grid using existing storefront engine, including:
  - product image
  - name
  - price
  - "কার্টে যোগ করুন" button.

4.4 Demo shop order:
- When placing an order on a demo shop:
  - create a food_orders-style record or a dedicated shop_order
    with is_demo = true.
  - Follow a simplified status flow:
    placed → accepted_demo → on_the_way_demo → delivered_demo
  - Do not affect real restaurant or shop wallets.

====================================================
5) CUSTOMER FLOW AFTER SIGNUP
====================================================

For a brand new BD customer:

- After signup + login (role=customer, countryCode="BD"):
  - Redirect to a BD customer home where:
    * Regular global services: Ride, Eats, Parcel
    * BD-specific services: Tickets, Rentals, Shops
    are all visible as separate options.

- Customer should be able to:
  1) Click into Tickets → search demo routes → book demo ticket.
  2) Click into Rentals → see demo vehicles → send demo rental request.
  3) Click into Shops → see demo shops → place demo order.

- No KYC is required for customer to see demo data.

====================================================
6) SECURITY & GUARDS
====================================================

- Demo operators and demo shops must be treated like normal operators
  from the customer perspective, but:
  - Their internal records are flagged is_demo=true.
  - They must still not expose any sensitive KYC data to customers.

- Ensure:
  - Only admin can see the internal is_demo flag and manage demo entities.
  - Drivers/operators cannot see customer sensitive data.

====================================================
7) NON-BREAKING GUARANTEE
====================================================

- Do NOT modify existing schema of:
  - rides
  - food_orders
  - deliveries
- Only add:
  - new collections (ticket_booking, rental_vehicles, rental_booking,
    shop_order) or extend existing ones with additive fields (is_demo, etc.).
- Do NOT rename existing enums, roles, or fields.
- Do NOT change US flows or existing customer navigation for US.

====================================================
8) MODULES / FILES TO UPDATE (GUIDELINE)
====================================================

Frontend (additive only):
- Customer navbar / home:
  - client/src/modules/customer/CustomerHome.tsx
  - or whichever module renders Ride/Eats/Parcel tabs
- BD Tickets:
  - reuse existing /bd/ticket-search, ensure it is reachable from BD home
- BD Rentals:
  - client/src/modules/customer/bd/BdRentalsPage.tsx
  - client/src/modules/customer/bd/BdRentalDetailsPage.tsx
- BD Shops:
  - client/src/modules/customer/bd/BdShopsPage.tsx
  - existing shop storefront module

Backend (additive only):
- BD ticket demo seeding and API helpers
- BD rentals:
  - rental_vehicles and rental_booking collections + customer API
- BD shops demo seeding and /api/bd/shops endpoint

All changes must be additive. After implementation, test:

1) BD customer with no operators in DB:
   - still sees demo tickets, rentals, shops, all usable.
2) BD customer with real operators:
   - sees real data first, demo only as fallback if needed.
3) US customer:
   - never sees BD-specific entries.
