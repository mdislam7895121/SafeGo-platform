SAFEGO MASTER RULES (MUST INCLUDE IN EVERY SAFEGO PROMPT)
[KEEP EXACTLY THE SAME SAFEGO RULES AS PREVIOUS PROMPT — DO NOT REMOVE ANYTHING.]

TASK: RESTORE “YOU SAVED $X” DISPLAY ON CHOOSE RIDE CARDS (UBER-LIKE)

CURRENT ISSUE
Previously customer could always see savings like “You saved $10”.
Now the vehicle cards show price/ETA/seats but NO savings/discount.

GOAL
On each vehicle option card:
- If savings exists (>0): show a small badge “Save $X” (or “You saved $X”) near the vehicle image/title.
- Under price, show “Was $Y” crossed out + “Now $Z” (optional but preferred).
- Must work for BOTH countries (US/BD) and all services (Ride/Food/Parcel) without breaking existing flows.

DATA RULES (BACKEND + FRONTEND)
1) Quote API must return:
   - final_fare (number)
   - currency (string, from backend)
   - original_fare (number, nullable)
   - savings_amount (number, nullable)
   - discount_reason (string, nullable; e.g. promo/intro/rounding)
2) Frontend must compute savings if missing:
   - if original_fare exists and final_fare exists: savings_amount = max(0, original_fare - final_fare)
3) If savings_amount <= 0: hide savings UI (no empty badge).

UI SPEC (WEB)
- Badge style: small pill, high contrast, clean
- Example:
  - Top-right of vehicle image: “Save $10”
- Price line:
  - If savings: show “$Y” (strikethrough, muted) then “$Z” (bold)
  - Else show only “$Z”
- Keep layout stable (no jumping).

WHERE TO CHANGE
- Identify the component that renders each vehicle card in the “Choose a ride” list.
- Add savings UI there.
- Ensure it works on both ride-request-page.tsx and bd-ride-booking.tsx (or shared component they use).

ADMIN CONFIG (NON-BREAKING)
- Add optional admin setting for default promo:
  - enabled (boolean)
  - savings_type: fixed_amount | percent
  - value
  - applies_to: ride | food | parcel
  - country: US | BD
- Must be additive, nullable fields only. No breaking migrations.

SECURITY / PERMISSIONS
- Customers see only their own quote + savings.
- Drivers do NOT see admin promo config.
- Only admin can change promo/discount settings.

ACCEPTANCE TEST
1) Open Choose a ride → at least one vehicle shows “Save $X”.
2) If savings is 0, badge hidden.
3) Currency matches backend (US=$, BD=৳ or backend currency code).
4) No regression in booking flow.
