I need you to fully finalize the SafeGo Admin Dashboard and SafePilot system for production.  
You must complete the following tasks without skipping anything:

===========================================
1. MOBILE RESPONSIVE ADMIN DESIGN (CRITICAL)
===========================================
Fix all mobile layout problems across the entire admin dashboard:
- Dashboard pages must resize correctly on screens 360px–1440px.
- All sidebars must collapse smoothly with no overflow.
- Tables must convert to mobile card-view.
- Charts, analytics widgets, notifications, and intelligence modules must fully support touch.
- Quick Action buttons must realign into a 2-column grid on mobile.
- SafePilot Intelligence page must be 100% usable on mobile.

Test across:
- iPhone 12/13/14/15, iPhone SE
- Android Pixel sizes
- Safari + Chrome mobile

===========================================
2. FIX SAFEPILOT ERROR (API + FRONTEND)
===========================================
Fix the issue:
“Failed to process your question. Please try again.”

You must:
- Inspect server/routes/safepilot.ts
- Ensure Vision 2030 response parser matches backend output
- Validate JSON structure:
    { mode, summary, signals, actions, monitor }
- Ensure POST /api/safepilot works for all queries
- Add error handling + retry logic
- Fix any CORS, payload, or validation issues
- Return correct structured response every time

===========================================
3. SAFEPILOT 2030 — FINAL POLISH
===========================================
SafePilot must respond perfectly in structured format:
- ASK mode
- WATCH mode
- GUARD mode
- OPTIMIZE mode

Output must always include:
1. Mode  
2. Summary  
3. Key Signals  
4. Actions with Risk Tags  
5. What to Monitor  

Test with queries:
- “Show me the most risky drivers last 24 hours”
- “Are there any fraud alerts?”
- “How can we reduce operating costs this week?”
- “Which trips have location integrity problems?”

===========================================
4. PRODUCTION READINESS CHECKLIST
===========================================
Before finishing, verify:
- No console errors (mobile + desktop)
- No failed API calls
- No unhandled promise rejections
- All SafePilot modules render on mobile
- All intelligence tabs (1–18) work flawlessly
- Memory usage and bundle size optimized

===========================================
5. REPORT BACK
===========================================
When completed, show me:
- Screenshot of SafePilot working
- Screenshot of admin dashboard mobile layout
- Summary of everything fixed
- Any remaining warnings (if any)

Do not ask me questions.  
Just complete everything and deliver a fully working, mobile-ready, production-ready SafePilot + Admin console.
