Upgrade SafePilot to match the exact behavior we require:

1. Response Intelligence
   - SafePilot must ALWAYS respond using the Vision-2030 structured format:
     • MODE  
     • SUMMARY  
     • KEY SIGNALS  
     • ACTIONS (with SAFE / CAUTION / HIGH RISK tags)  
     • WHAT TO MONITOR  
   - No empty responses allowed. If data is missing, SafePilot must say:
     “Data unavailable — switching to fallback analysis using last 24h telemetry.”

2. Automatic Mode Detection
   - ASK mode → normal questions  
   - WATCH mode → risk, monitoring, alerts  
   - GUARD mode → fraud, abuse, suspicious patterns  
   - OPTIMIZE mode → revenue, cost, improvement  

   SafePilot must detect mode 100% accurately.

3. Data Layer Fix
   - SafePilot must use REAL database fields for:
     • drivers  
     • trips  
     • payouts  
     • chargebacks  
     • disputes  
     • customer flags  
     • fraud markers  
     • device signals  

   No placeholder or undefined fields permitted.

4. Context Tab Fix
   - The Context tab must ALWAYS load.
   - If context is unavailable, SafePilot must fetch:
     • request logs  
     • recent admin activity  
     • last 50 events  
     • platform telemetry  
   And rebuild the context view automatically.

5. UI Integration
   - Replace ALL old SafePilot icons and logos with the new SafePilot brand pack:

     safepilot_full_logo_light_mode.png  
     safepilot_full_logo_dark_mode.png  
     safepilot_mobile_app_icon.png  

   - Apply consistently to:
     • header  
     • floating button  
     • drawer  
     • tabs  
     • intelligence dashboard  

6. Safety & Enforcement
   - If SafePilot detects HIGH RISK:
     • Automatically prepare an admin alert
     • Include evidence
     • Include recommended action
     • Never send empty or partial messages

7. Error Handling
   - If any backend error occurs:
     “System issue detected — attempting automated recovery.”
   - Then retry 2 times before sending final output.

8. Final Requirement
   - SafePilot must behave EXACTLY like a real enterprise AI supervisor:
     • No silent failures  
     • No empty responses  
     • No broken context  
     • Always structured  
     • Always actionable
