========================
Offline state:

- On tap → driver_online_status = "online"

Online state:
- Show red power icon + “Go Offline”
- On tap → driver_online_status = "offline"

Toast notifications:
- “You’re now online”
- “You’re now offline”

========================
DRIVER STATUS FLOW (MUST KEEP SAFEGO RULES)
