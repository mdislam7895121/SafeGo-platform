You are working inside the SafeGo-platform repo (Replit). Task: Fix SafePilot so it answers different questions with different answers, and ensure Admin SafePilot uses the Admin model/logic while Customer Support SafePilot uses Support model/logic only. Do NOT refactor unrelated UI. Make minimal, safe, targeted changes. Add tests and clear logs. Preserve existing styling as much as possible.

CONTEXT / SYMPTOMS (confirmed by screenshots):
- The floating SafePilot widget shows different tabs/modes (Intel/Context/Chat, Ultra/Crisis/Survival/History etc.), but clicking or asking different questions often returns the same “morning report/guard mode” style output.
- Example: “how do i improve drivers” and “how many drivers is pending” return the same Driver Operations (morning report) block.
- Example: payout anomalies/support tickets questions still return the same generic security/guard summary.
- Admin SafePilot must answer admin operations questions (drivers, KYC, payouts, fraud, platform KPIs, restaurants, parcels, wallets, disputes, refunds, etc.) using the ADMIN data + ADMIN prompt/model.
- Customer Support SafePilot must remain limited to support workflows and must NOT leak into admin workflows.

HIGH-LEVEL GOAL:
1) Implement reliable INTENT + QUESTION-TYPE detection so SafePilot routes to the correct handler and returns different answers.
2) Enforce strict separation:
   - Admin SafePilot widget -> uses AdminSafePilot pipeline (admin model/prompt/data).
   - Support console SafePilot -> uses SupportSafePilot pipeline (support model/prompt/data).
3) Make responses professional: clean, concise by default, no forced “[MODE]” headers, no repetitive “morning report” unless explicitly requested.
4) Add a Settings modal for SafePilot (gear icon) with an exact list below. Settings must actually affect behavior.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (must verify in Preview):
A. Question routing:
- “how many drivers is pending” -> returns ONLY the number + short label (concise): e.g., “2 drivers are pending verification.”
- “how do i improve drivers” -> returns recommendations only (no stats dump) unless user asks “show driver status”.
- “
