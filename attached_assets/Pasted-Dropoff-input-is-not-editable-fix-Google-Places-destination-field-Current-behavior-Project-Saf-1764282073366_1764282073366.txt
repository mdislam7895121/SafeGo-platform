Dropoff input is not editable – fix Google Places destination field

Current behavior
- Project: SafeGo customer web app on Replit.
- Pickup field works: I can type and select a Google Places suggestion.
- Destination field ("Where to?") is broken:
  - I cannot type anything in the destination box (keyboard appears but text does not stay), OR
  - sometimes suggestions show but tapping them does not update the input.
- Effect: The user cannot set a dropoff address, so price and route cannot be calculated.

Your tasks

1. Find the destination input implementation
   - Locate the component used for the destination/dropoff field on the customer home page, likely something like:
     - `GooglePlacesInput`, `LocationSearchInput`, or similar
     - in `client/src/components` or `client/src/pages/customer`.
   - Identify the props/state that control the destination field (value, onChange, onSelect, disabled, readOnly, etc.).

2. Make the destination input fully editable
   - Ensure the destination input is a normal controlled text input:
     - `value` is bound to destination state.
     - `onChange` updates that destination state as the user types.
   - Remove or fix anything that prevents typing:
     - No `readOnly` or `disabled` flags for the destination field when the user is entering an address.
     - No `pointer-events: none`, overlay div, or z-index hack blocking taps on mobile.
   - Make sure no `onBlur` or `useEffect` logic is immediately resetting the value and making the box look empty or frozen.

3. Fix Google Places selection for destination
   - When the user taps a suggestion in the dropdown:
     - The destination input value must be set to the formatted address from Google (e.g., `"170-21 Jamaica Ave, Queens, NY, USA"`).
     - The internal destination state must store `place_id`, `lat`, and `lng`.
   - Use the same working logic as the pickup field (reuse the same hook/handler pattern from pickup for destination).

4. Do not break pickup or maps
   - Keep the existing behavior for:
     - pickup/current location detection,
     - reverse geocoding,
     - route directions and price estimation.
   - Do not change any Google Maps API key or CSP configuration.

5. Testing scenarios
   - Scenario 1: Desktop and mobile
     - Pickup: `188 Sutter Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11212, USA`.
     - Destination field: user types `"170-21"` and selects `"170-21 Jamaica Ave"` from suggestions.
     - Confirm:
       - User can type freely in the destination box.
       - After selection, the full address appears in the input.
       - Internal destination state has place_id and coordinates.
   - Scenario 2:
     - Tap "See prices".
     - Confirm the app uses these same pickup and destination values without asking for the addresses again on the next screen.

6. Report back
   - List which files and components you changed.
   - Explain what was preventing typing and how you fixed it.
   - Confirm that both typing and suggestion selection now work correctly in the destination input on both desktop and mobile.
