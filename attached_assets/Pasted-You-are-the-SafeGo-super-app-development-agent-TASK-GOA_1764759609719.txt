You are the SafeGo super-app development agent.

TASK GOAL (THIS LOOP ONLY)
=================================
On the customer home page `/customer`, replace the current SERVICE DROPDOWN (Ride / Eats / Parcel / Tickets / Rental / Shop) with a modern **service card grid** that appears **right under the "Available rides" car list**.

The new design must:
- Keep all existing SafeGo behavior (map, ride list, prices, service switching).
- Reuse the same internal service-switch logic the dropdown uses today.
- Look visually modern: dynamic cards, thin glowing edges, bold labels.
- Work on mobile and desktop.
- Not break any existing routes or APIs.

DO NOT modify login, signup, role, or backend business logic.
Only change the FRONTEND service selector UI and its wiring.

High-level behaviour
=================================
- We currently have a "service type" selector as a dropdown near the top (Ride / Eats / Parcel / Tickets / Rental / Shop).
- We want to **remove that dropdown** from the top header and replace it with a **horizontal grid of cards** placed under the “Available rides” section, while keeping the same state and switching logic.

Think of it as:
- The service value (ride / eats / parcel / tickets / rental / shop) stays exactly the same internally.
- Only the UI for choosing it is changed.

1. FIND CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION
=================================
1. Locate the React/TypeScript component(s) that render the `/customer` page:
   - Usually something like `CustomerHome`, `CustomerRootPage`, or similar under `client/src/.../customer`.
2. Find:
   - The current service dropdown (the one with items Ride, Eats, Parcel, Tickets, Rental, Shop).
   - The state / context / hook that stores the active service (for example: `service`, `activeTab`, `selectedMode`, etc.).
   - The function that runs when the service changes, for example:
     - `handleServiceChange("ride")`
     - or `setService("eats")`
     - or a router-based handler that pushes a query string like `?mode=ride`.
3. IMPORTANT:
   - Do NOT change the underlying values for each service. The canonical keys must stay:
     - `"ride"`, `"eats"`, `"parcel"`, `"tickets"`, `"rental"`, `"shop"`.
   - We will just call the same handler from the new card UI.

2. REMOVE DROPDOWN, KEEP LOGIC
=================================
1. In the header of `/customer`, **visually remove** the service dropdown component:
   - Either delete the JSX for the dropdown, or replace it with a simple `current service` label if needed.
   - Make sure you DO NOT delete:
     - The state initialization for the service.
     - The shared handler for switching service.
   - We only remove the UI element, not the logic.

2. Confirm after this that:
   - The page still builds and renders.
   - Internally, `activeService` (or similar) is still defined and used by:
     - The "Available rides" / "Available shops" / etc.
     - Any queries for rides, foods, parcels, tickets, rentals, shops.

3. IMPLEMENT SERVICE CARD GRID COMPONENT
=================================
Create a reusable component, for example:

   `ServiceGrid.tsx` or `ServiceSelectorGrid.tsx`

Props (you can adjust names to fit existing style):

   - `activeService: ServiceType`   // "ride" | "eats" | "parcel" | "tickets" | "rental" | "shop"
   - `onChange(service: ServiceType): void`

The component must render **six cards** representing the services:

   1. Ride
   2. Eats
   3. Parcel
   4. Tickets
   5. Rental
   6. Shop

Each card definition (pseudo-code):

```ts
const serviceItems: Array<{
  key: ServiceType;
  label: string;
  description: string;
  icon: ReactNode; // use existing icon components if available
}> = [
  { key: "ride",    label: "Ride",    description: "Trips with drivers",      icon: <CarIcon /> },
  { key: "eats",    label: "Eats",    description: "Food delivery",          icon: <ForkIcon /> },
  { key: "parcel",  label: "Parcel",  description: "Send packages",          icon: <BoxIcon /> },
  { key: "tickets", label: "Tickets", description: "Bus / launch tickets",   icon: <TicketIcon /> },
  { key: "rental",  label: "Rental",  description: "Car & micro rentals",    icon: <CarRentalIcon /> },
  { key: "shop",    label: "Shop",    description: "Local stores & grocery", icon: <ShopIcon /> },
