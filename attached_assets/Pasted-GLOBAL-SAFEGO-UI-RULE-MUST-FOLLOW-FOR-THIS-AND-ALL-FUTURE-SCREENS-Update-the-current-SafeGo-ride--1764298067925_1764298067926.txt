GLOBAL SAFEGO UI RULE (MUST FOLLOW FOR THIS AND ALL FUTURE SCREENS)

Update the current SafeGo ride & promo UI so that it works perfectly on BOTH mobile and desktop web.

Do NOT touch the pricing logic, promo math, or backend APIs. Only improve layout, responsiveness, and visual hierarchy.

Requirements:

1) Responsive Breakpoints
   - Mobile: up to ~480px
   - Tablet: ~768–1024px
   - Desktop: 1280px and above

2) Layout Behavior
   - Mobile:
     - Single-column layout.
     - Map on top, then fare card, then promo details.
     - Buttons full-width.
   - Desktop:
     - Two-column layout:
       - Left: map and route selector.
       - Right: fare breakdown, promo tags, payment method, CTA buttons.
     - Keep a max-width container centered for large screens.

3) Shared Components
   - Use the same React components for mobile and desktop; only the layout/grid changes with CSS breakpoints.
   - No duplicate markup for mobile vs desktop.

4) Fare & Promo Card UI
   - Mobile:
     - Show final price big and bold at the top.
     - Under it show: anchor price (strikethrough), “You saved $X.XX”, promo badge.
   - Desktop:
     - Same information, but arranged in a card with clearer sections:
       - Top: ride type + ETA + price.
       - Middle: promo info + savings.
       - Bottom: detailed breakdown (expand/collapse).

5) Technical Implementation
   - Use the existing design system (buttons, cards, typography).
   - Use CSS grid or flex with media queries (or existing tailwind/breakpoint system, if present).
   - Do NOT hardcode pixel values per device; use sensible breakpoints.

6) Testing
   - Verify layout on:
     - ~390px (iPhone)
     - ~768px (iPad)
     - ~1440px (laptop)
   - Ensure nothing overflows, text doesn’t get cut, and cards don’t look cramped on desktop.

7) No Logic Changes
   - Do not change any pricing calculations.
   - Do not change API contracts.
   - Only change JSX/layout and styling for responsiveness.

After changes, the same URL must look professional both on phone and on laptop/desktop.
