====================================================
TASK: Move the trip selector footer button from LEFT to RIGHT
====================================================

Screen: /driver/map (driver app map view)

Current state:
- Bottom center: green “Go Online” button (correct).
- Bottom left: circular trip selector button (hamburger icon).
- Bottom right: no footer button.

Required state:
- Bottom center: keep “Go Online / Go Offline” button exactly as it is (centered).
- Bottom RIGHT: trip selector button (hamburger icon) must move here.
- Bottom LEFT: no footer button is needed for now (leave empty).

-----------------------------------
1) Reposition the trip selector button
-----------------------------------
The existing trip selector button (hamburger icon) should be moved from bottom-left to bottom-right of the MAP area.

Inside the map content wrapper (position: relative):

Center button (Go Online / Go Offline) – KEEP:
- position: absolute;
- bottom: 24px;
- left: 50%;
- transform: translateX(-50%);
- z-index: 10;

Trip selector button – CHANGE to bottom-right:
- position: absolute;
- bottom: 24px;
- right: 24px;       // instead of left: 24px
- z-index: 10;

There should be no other footer button at bottom-left after this change.

-----------------------------------
2) Avoid overlap with right-side vertical FAB stack
-----------------------------------
- Keep the existing vertical stack of circular buttons on the right side of the map (reload, earnings, shield, navigation, etc.) unchanged.
- Ensure the new bottom-right trip selector button appears BELOW this vertical stack and does not overlap it.
  Example:
  - vertical stack bottom: ~112px
  - trip selector bottom: 24px

-----------------------------------
3) Keep existing behavior/logics
-----------------------------------
- Tapping the trip selector button must still open the trip-type selector drawer (Comfort / XL / etc.) with on/off toggles.
- Do NOT change its click handler, only its position.
- Do NOT modify Go Online/Go Offline logic, colors, or backend calls.

-----------------------------------
4) Non-breaking requirement
-----------------------------------
- Do NOT touch any DB schema, APIs, or backend logic.
- Do NOT modify commission/KYC/admin/status engines.
- Only adjust the layout so that:
   • Go Online button stays centered at the bottom of the map,
   • Trip selector button appears at bottom-right,
   • Bottom-left stays empty.

Apply all changes in a single update, with no questions.
