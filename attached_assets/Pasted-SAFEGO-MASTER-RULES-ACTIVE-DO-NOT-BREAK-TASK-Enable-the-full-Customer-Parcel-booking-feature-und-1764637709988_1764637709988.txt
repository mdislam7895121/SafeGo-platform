SAFEGO MASTER RULES ACTIVE — DO NOT BREAK

TASK:
Enable the full Customer Parcel booking feature under /customer/parcel following SafeGo rules. Remove the “Coming soon…” placeholder and implement the complete parcel workflow.

ROLES:
Customer can:
- create parcel delivery requests
- set pickup & dropoff
- select parcel type
- choose delivery speed
- see fare estimate
- confirm booking
- track driver (after accepted)
- pay via CASH or ONLINE

Driver cannot see this page. Admin has separate parcel management.

MANDATORY IMPLEMENTATION:

1. CUSTOMER PARCEL BOOKING UI (REPLACE “COMING SOON”)
Create a new booking interface with:
- Pickup address input (with geolocation + suggestions)
- Dropoff address input (with geolocation + suggestions)
- Parcel type dropdown:
   • Documents
   • Small Package
   • Medium Box
   • Large Box
- Weight selector (optional, kg/lbs)
- Delivery speed:
   • Standard
   • Express
- Fare estimate (auto-calculated using existing pricing engine)
- Confirm Parcel Delivery button

2. STATUS FLOW (MUST MATCH SAFEGO RULES)
requested
→ searching_driver
→ accepted
→ picked_up
→ on_the_way
→ delivered
OR:
cancelled_by_customer
cancelled_by_driver
cancelled_by_admin

3. COLLECTION (deliveries)
Every new parcel request must save:
- customer_id
- driver_id (null until accepted)
- parcel_type
- pickup_address + geolocation
- dropoff_address + geolocation
- weight
- delivery_speed
- fare
- payment_method
- commission fields (same rules as rides/food)
- timestamps for each status
- rating & feedback after completed

4. PAYMENT RULES (MANDATORY)
If CASH:
- Driver receives full cash
- Commission added as negative driver_balance

If ONLINE:
- SafeGo keeps commission automatically

5. DRIVER APP PARCEL TASKS (NO CROSS ROLE VIEW)
Driver sees:
- new parcel request
- pickup → on the way → dropoff
- can mark picked_up / delivered
- cannot see customer KYC or sensitive info

6. ADMIN PANEL (SEPARATE)
Admin can:
- see all parcel orders
- manage driver payouts
- manage parcel pricing
- manage commission

7. SECURITY RULES
- Customer sees only their own parcel orders
- Driver sees only assigned parcels
- Admin sees everything
- No access mix between roles

UI STYLE:
Use the same booking card style as Customer Ride & Food pages so design remains consistent. Do NOT break mobile layout.

DELIVERABLES:
- Fully functional Customer Parcel booking page
- Connected to deliveries collection
- Connected to driver request system
- Uses existing SafeGo map engine + autocomplete
- Replaces placeholder “Coming soon…”
