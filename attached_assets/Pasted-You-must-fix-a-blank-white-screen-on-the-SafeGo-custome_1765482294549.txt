You must fix a blank white screen on the SafeGo customer web app.

Context:
- Workspace: ReplitBackend (SafeGo global project)
- Landing page at "/" is working again and MUST NOT be redesigned or replaced.
- After signup / login, when navigating to the customer home route, the page becomes fully white.
- Example URL (from my browser): https://<current-preview>.replit.dev/customer (white screen, no UI).

Your tasks:

1. Reproduce the bug
   - Start the application normally.
   - In the browser, go through the normal flow:
     a) Open "/" (landing page) – confirm it loads.
     b) Click "Sign up" or "Log in" and create/sign in to a customer account.
     c) Navigate to the main customer app route ("/customer" or whatever route is supposed to open after login).
   - Confirm that this route shows a blank white page.

2. Inspect logs and errors
   - Open browser devtools console (or use a headless browser) and capture any JavaScript errors when loading the customer route.
   - Check the server logs for any 500 errors or route errors when "/customer" is requested.
   - Pay special attention to:
     - React Router route configuration for "/customer"
     - Auth guards / ProtectedRoute logic
     - Layout or Suspense wrappers that might swallow errors
     - Missing component exports (default vs named export mismatch)

3. Audit the routing and components for the customer app
   - Locate the main route configuration file (e.g. client/src/App.tsx or client/src/routes/index.tsx) and find the route that should render the customer home screen.
   - Verify:
     - The path mapping for "/customer" (or equivalent) points to a valid component.
     - The component file actually exports a React component of the correct type.
     - Any layout or nested routes for the customer area are wired correctly.
   - Check any hooks used there (e.g. useAuth, useCustomerContext, useQuery) for runtime errors when user is null, token missing, or data not yet loaded.

4. Fix the root cause
   - If there is a React runtime error (TypeError, Cannot read property of undefined, etc.), fix it with the smallest possible change:
     - Add null checks for user/session.
     - Fix incorrect imports / exports.
     - Fix incorrect element passed to React Router (e.g. `element={<CustomerHome />}` not `element={CustomerHome}` in v6).
   - If the issue is caused by bad route guards:
     - Make sure unauthenticated users are redirected to "/login".
     - Make sure authenticated customers are allowed into "/customer".
   - If the issue is a failed API call that blocks rendering:
     - Add proper loading & error states so the page still renders the shell instead of staying blank.
   - Do NOT create a new landing page and do NOT change the global landing layout. Only fix what is needed for the customer area.

5. Verify that everything still works
   - Test the following without errors or blank pages:
     - "/" (public landing page)
     - Signup & login flow for a customer
     - Redirect after login to the customer app ("/customer" or equivalent)
     - Any sub-routes under the customer app (e.g. ride, food, parcel tabs)
   - Confirm no new console errors were introduced.
   - Confirm the app still respects existing SafeGo rules:
     - Single shared backend for pricing/status.
     - No duplicate logic in the landing page for ride/food/parcel.
     - Bangladesh vs US logic remains unchanged.

6. Report back
   - Explain clearly:
     - What was the exact root cause of the white screen on the customer route?
     - Which files you changed (with paths).
     - The exact code-level fix you applied.
   - Do NOT refactor unrelated modules. Only fix the bug causing the white screen on the customer page.
