STEP 46 – PHASE 3  
Implement FULL Driver UI for SafeGo Eats food delivery workflow.

Backend dispatch engine is already complete.  
Now build the DRIVER APP SCREENS that connect to the new delivery endpoints.

You must follow ALL SafeGo Master Rules, keep everything backward-compatible,
and DO NOT modify any backend logic already generated.

============================
REQUIRED DRIVER UI SCREENS
============================

1. DriverDeliveriesInboxScreen
   - Tabs:
     • New Requests
     • Active
     • Completed
   - For each delivery card show:
     • restaurant name
     • pickup address
     • dropoff address
     • payout amount
     • distance/ETA (if backend provides)
     • Accept / Reject buttons for “New Requests”
   - Connect buttons:
     POST /driver/deliveries/accept
     POST /driver/deliveries/reject

2. DriverDeliveryRequestDetailScreen
   - Shows:
     • items summary
     • total amount
     • payment method (cash/online)
     • customer delivery instructions
     • map with pickup + dropoff markers
   - Buttons:
     • Accept Delivery
     • Reject Delivery

3. DriverActiveDeliveryScreen
   - This is the workflow for an accepted order.
   - Show:
     • restaurant info
     • customer info (masked)
     • order summary
     • delivery id + food order id
     • live map showing driver → customer route
   - Actions:
     • “Picked Up Order”
       → POST /driver/deliveries/status {status:"picked_up"}
     • “On the Way”
       → POST /driver/deliveries/status {status:"on_the_way"}
     • “Delivered”
       → POST /driver/deliveries/status {status:"delivered"}

   - Update driver location:
     Use POST /driver/deliveries/location periodically.

4. DriverDeliveriesHistoryScreen
   - Paginated list from GET /driver/deliveries/history
   - Show:
     • date
     • earning
     • status
     • delivery id

============================
UI/UX RULES
============================
- Must match SafeGo’s design components used in Ride UI.
- Mobile friendly.
- Verified drivers only (is_verified = true).
- Restrict access for:
  blocked = true or verification_status ≠ "approved".

============================
INTEGRATION RULES
============================
- Driver sees ONLY deliveries assigned to them.
- Driver cannot see customer government ID.
- Driver cannot access any restaurant documents.
- For cash deliveries:
  Show: “Customer will pay cash.”
  But DO NOT modify wallet/commission logic.

============================
DEMO MODE SUPPORT
============================
If enableFoodDeliveryDemo = true:
- Provide a mock driver UI flow that auto-refreshes.
- Auto-status simulation allowed only for demo orders.

============================
OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
============================
Deliver:
- All driver UI screens
- Navigation links in Driver App sidebar/menu
- Full connection to backend endpoints
- Error handling & confirmation dialogs
- Optional map or static placeholder if live map not available

Do NOT modify:
- Customer UI
- Restaurant UI
- Admin UI
- Any backend logic
