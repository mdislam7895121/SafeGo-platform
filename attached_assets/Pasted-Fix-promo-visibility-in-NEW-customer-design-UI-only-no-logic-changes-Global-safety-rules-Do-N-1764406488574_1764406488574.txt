Fix promo visibility in NEW customer design (UI only, no logic changes)

Global safety rules:
- Do NOT change:
  - Promo / discount / commission calculation
  - Fare engine, quote API, routes, DB schema or any backend function
- You may ONLY update UI components and layout on the NEW customer booking experience.

Goal:
In the new /customer unified design, promotions are active in pricing, but the rider cannot SEE them. I want the UI to clearly show:
1) there is an active SafeGo promo on this ride, and  
2) how much the rider is saving, similar to Uber.

Use existing quote / promo data only (e.g. originalFare, finalFare, discountAmount, discountPercent, promoName). Do not invent new fields.

--------------------------------
STEP 1 – Find where the new customer design reads promo data

1. Locate the React/TSX component that renders the NEW /customer ride list (the SafeGo Ride tab with cards like “SafeGo X”, “SafeGo Comfort”, etc.).
2. Identify how the price is currently coming from the quote object.
3. Identify any existing properties such as:
   - originalFare / baseFareBeforePromo
   - discountedFare / totalFare
   - discountAmount
   - discountPercent
   - promoName / promoType (e.g. “SafeGo Everyday Saver”)

Do NOT change how these values are calculated. Just reuse them for UI.

--------------------------------
STEP 2 – Add a global promo strip under the address capsule

On the NEW /customer page, when a promo is active for the current quote:

1. Directly under the address capsule (the two-line pickup/dropoff capsule) and above “Choose a ride”, render a global promo strip:

   - Full-width bar with:
       background: #DCFCE7  (light SafeGo green)
       text color: #166534
       border-radius: 9999px
       padding: 8–10px vertical, 16px horizontal

   - Left content:
       icon: green lightning or tag
       bold label: `SafeGo Everyday Saver`
       secondary text:
         - If you have discountPercent: `• {discountPercent}% off your ride`
         - If you only have discountAmount: `• You save ${discountAmount.toFixed(2)} on this ride`

   - Right side:
       small neutral text: `Applied automatically`
       (Do NOT add a “Remove” button here unless there is already business logic for removing the promo. We only show that this promo is active.)

2. Only show this strip when:
   - There is an active promo in the quote for at least one ride option, AND
   - discountAmount > 0 (or discountPercent > 0).

3. On mobile:
   - The promo strip must be fully visible and sit between the address capsule and the “Choose your ride” section.
   - It must not push the map off-screen; use vertical stacking only.

--------------------------------
STEP 3 – Show savings clearly on each ride card

In each ride option card (SafeGo X, SafeGo Comfort, SafeGo XL, etc.):

1. Price area:
   - Show the **discounted fare** as the main price in bold, large, black text.
   - If originalFare > discountedFare:
       - Show `originalFare` to the right or directly under the main price as:
           - smaller font
           - gray color (#6B7280)
           - with strikethrough.

2. Savings text:
   - If discountAmount > 0 for that specific option, show a line under the price:
       - Text: `You save $X.XX`
         where X.XX = discountAmount for this option (to two decimals).
       - Style:
           color: #16A34A
           font-size: small but readable
           font-weight: 500

3. Badges:
   - Keep the existing “Popular” badge on SafeGo X.
   - Keep or add a “Saver” badge on any option with a promo:
       - Small pill with:
           background: #BBF7D0
           color: #166534
           text: `Saver`
   - Make sure badges, price, and savings line are visually balanced (no overlap, no wrapping into ugly lines).

4. Important: If a specific ride type has **no** discount, then:
   - Show only the normal price (no strikethrough, no “You save” text, no “Saver” badge) for that card.

--------------------------------
STEP 4 – Keep desktop + mobile consistent

1. On desktop width:
   - Global promo strip visible under the address capsule.
   - Each card shows:
       - discounted price
       - original strikethrough price (when promo exists)
       - “You save $X.XX” line (when promo exists)
       - badges (Popular, Saver) as designed.

2. On mobile width:
   - Use the same information and styles, but adjust spacing so:
       - No text is cut off
       - No horizontal scrolling is needed inside the card
       - The promo strip and “You save” lines remain readable.

3. Confirm that route selection and fare summary screens still show the same discounted totals and that you did not touch the promo engine at all.

--------------------------------
STEP 5 – Testing

1. Create or use a scenario where a SafeGo Everyday Saver promo is active.
2. From `/customer`, enter pickup & dropoff and open the ride list.
3. Verify:
   - Global promo strip appears under the address capsule.
   - Each discounted ride card clearly shows:
       - discounted fare
       - original strikethrough fare
       - “You save $X.XX”
       - “Saver” badge where applicable.
4. Turn off promo (if such a state exists) and confirm:
   - Global promo strip disappears.
   - Cards no longer show strikethrough prices or “You save” lines.
5. Report back which component(s) were updated and confirm no backend or pricing logic was modified.
