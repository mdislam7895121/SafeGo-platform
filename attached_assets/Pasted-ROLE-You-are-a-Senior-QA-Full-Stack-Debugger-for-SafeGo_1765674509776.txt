ROLE: You are a Senior QA + Full-Stack Debugger for SafeGo.
Goal: Make EVERY customer page work correctly before ANY deployment work.

NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES:
- Do NOT talk about deployment, production, or publish until ALL pages pass.
- Do NOT add new features.
- Do NOT refactor unrelated code.
- Fix only what is broken, then prove it with repeatable checks.
- If data is missing, create SAFE demo seed data (country-aware BD/US) so UI is not empty.

SCOPE: CUSTOMER APP ROUTES + CORE APIs
You MUST verify on BOTH Desktop and Mobile viewport.

PAGES THAT MUST WORK (NO EXCEPTIONS):
1) /customer (home)
2) /customer/ride
3) /customer/eats
4) /customer/parcel
5) Any “Explore services” navigation that links from /customer
6) Login/session protected routes must behave correctly (redirect, not blank)

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (PASS/FAIL):
A) No blank screens
B) No broken layout (overlap, cut map tiles, scroll lock issues)
C) No console errors that affect functionality
D) All CTAs work (Request ride, open eats list, open parcel request)
E) Empty states must be intentional and friendly (not broken UI)

MANDATORY DEBUG + FIX PLAN (DO IN ORDER):

STEP 1: ROUTE INVENTORY + NAV CHECK
- List every customer-facing route in the app (from router config).
- Click through from /customer to every service card.
- Fix any broken link, wrong route, or missing route handler.

STEP 2: RIDE PAGE (MAP + PLACES) HARD VERIFICATION
- Confirm Google Maps renders correctly on first load and after resize.
- Confirm tiles are not broken on Desktop and Mobile.
- Confirm pickup autocomplete works and selecting pickup updates state.
- Confirm dropoff input works (autocomplete + selection).
- If map breaks: fix container sizing, resize trigger, and ensure map reinitializes safely.
- Provide proof: browser console logs + screenshot description of correct map state.

STEP 3: EATS PAGE (DATA + FILTERS)
- If “No restaurants available” appears due to empty DB, seed demo restaurants and menus for BD and US.
- Confirm cuisines filter works, search works, and restaurant cards open.
- Confirm API returns data and UI shows it.
- Provide proof: API response sample + UI evidence.

STEP 4: PARCEL PAGE
- Verify location selection works (pickup/dropoff), no prop mismatch, no TypeScript runtime issues.
- Verify form submission path does not error and shows next state properly.
- Provide proof: console clean + UI flow steps.

STEP 5: SESSION + AUTH SANITY
- Verify session persists across refresh.
- Verify protected routes redirect correctly when unauthenticated.
- No infinite loops.

STEP 6: FINAL SMOKE TEST SCRIPT (REPEATABLE)
Create a simple manual test checklist inside docs/QA_SMOKE_CHECKLIST.md that includes:
- Steps to reproduce each pass condition for Ride/Eats/Parcel on Desktop and Mobile
- Expected results
This checklist must be usable by a non-developer.

FINAL RESPONSE FORMAT (STRICT):
1) Routes tested: (list)
2) FIXES MADE: (bullet list with file paths)
3) SMOKE TEST RESULTS:
   - /customer: PASS/FAIL
   - /customer/ride: PASS/FAIL
   - /customer/eats: PASS/FAIL
   - /customer/parcel: PASS/FAIL
4) Remaining issues (if any): must be only blockers; otherwise write “None”
5) Next action: “Ready for deployment prompt” ONLY if all are PASS

START NOW. Do not mention deployment until all PASS.
