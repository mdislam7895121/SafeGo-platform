SAFEGO GLOBAL — FIX CUSTOMER RIDE MAP LAYOUT (INLINE + ROUTE MODAL)

This change is purely frontend. It must be ADDITIVE and must not break any
SafeGo core rules (roles, KYC, rides/food_orders/deliveries, commissions, etc.).

====================================================
1) CONTEXT
====================================================
Customer Ride screen (/customer, mode=Ride) now has:
- An inline map preview in the booking card.
- A "Route Map" modal overlay.

Bug:
- When opening the Route Map, the map renders as a small tile in the middle
  instead of a full-screen map.
- The small map "floats" above, even though the modal background is full.
- Likely causes: bad container sizing, wrong position, and/or Leaflet
  not receiving a proper invalidateSize() call when modal opens.

Goal:
- Make the inline map look clean and fixed-height inside the booking card.
- Make the Route Map modal show ONE map instance that fills the modal.
- When the modal is closed, no small map fragment should remain floating.

====================================================
2) INLINE MAP REQUIREMENTS
====================================================
For the inline map inside the Ride booking page:

- Container should have a fixed height on mobile and desktop, e.g.:
  - mobile: ~200–240px
  - desktop: ~260–300px
- Use CSS classes like:
  - width: 100%
  - overflow: hidden
  - border-radius consistent with card design

- The map tiles must fill the container without overlapping or tiling
  beyond the visible box.

Implementation:
- Ensure the inline map component has its own wrapper:
  e.g. <RideInlineMap /> with a dedicated div (position: relative; height set).
- Leaflet map should be initialised with the container size already defined.
- If needed, hook into onResize or use a useEffect to call map.invalidateSize()
  when the inline map becomes visible.

====================================================
3) ROUTE MAP MODAL REQUIREMENTS
====================================================
The "Route Map" modal must:

- Use a full-screen fixed overlay container, e.g.:
  - position: fixed;
  - inset: 0;
  - display: flex;
  - flex-direction: column;
- Title bar at top ("Route Map" + close icon).
- Map area should take all remaining vertical space:
  - flex: 1;
  - min-height: 0;  // important so map can fill
- Bottom area for the "Done" button only.

Map sizing:
- The Leaflet map inside the modal should fill the available map area:
  - width: 100%;
  - height: 100%;
- On modal open:
  - After the component mounts and is visible, call map.invalidateSize()
    to fix tile positioning.

Very important:
- Only ONE map instance inside the modal.
- Do NOT nest the inline map component inside the modal.
- The modal should have its own dedicated map component or re-use the map
  logic but with a separate container DOM node.

====================================================
4) MODAL OPEN/CLOSE BEHAVIOR
====================================================
- Default state: Route Map modal closed.
- It should only open when:
  - user taps an explicit "Route Map" / "View Route" button OR
  - there is an active ride and user selects the route view.

- When closing:
  - Unmount the modal component completely (conditional rendering).
  - Clean up any map listeners.
  - No residual map div should stay floating over the booking UI.

- Ensure ESC and overlay click (if enabled) also close the modal.

====================================================
5) NON-BREAKING & ROLE SAFETY
====================================================
- Do NOT change any backend APIs or schemas.
- Do NOT touch rides collection logic or status flow.
- Keep all existing role access rules intact:
  - Only customers see this route map in /customer.
  - Drivers/admin views remain unchanged.

====================================================
6) FILES TO UPDATE (EXAMPLE)
====================================================
Frontend only, likely:

- client/src/modules/customer/ride/RidePage.tsx
- client/src/components/ride/RideInlineMap.tsx (new or existing)
- client/src/components/ride/RouteMapModal.tsx
- client/src/styles/ride-map.css (or Tailwind classes)

Do not rename existing exports; add or adjust layouts and styles only.

Test:
- Mobile viewport (iPhone) and desktop.
- Open Ride page with no active ride → inline map correct, no modal.
- Open Route Map from appropriate button → full-screen map ok.
- Close Route Map → returns cleanly, no floating small map.
