TASK: Add a new DRIVER SERVICE SELECTION DRAWER on the LEFT side, identical to the visual style of the reference grid (Comfort, UberX, Uber Pet style cards). Map and footer must remain unchanged.

========================
1. LEFT DRAWER ACTIVATION
========================
- Footer left icon opens this drawer.
- Drawer slides from LEFT (mobile + desktop).
- Title: “Your Active Services”.
- Background: #000000 or dark mode container (same style as screenshot).

========================
2. GRID UI (MUST MATCH REFERENCE EXACTLY)
========================
Each service displayed as:
- A large rounded-rectangle card
- Dark background (#101010 to #181818)
- Thin light outline when OFF
- Bright white outline + white checkmark when ON
- Icon (person/car/motor/pet etc.)
- Service name under icon

Layout:
- 2 columns grid
- Equal spacing
- Responsive on desktop/tablet

Sizes:
- Card height: ~150px
- Border radius: 20px
- Border width:
    • Selected: 2px white
    • Unselected: 1px subtle grey (#333)

Checkmark:
- Top-right corner
- White square outline when OFF
- White filled box with check icon when ON

========================
3. LIST OF SAFEGO SERVICES (SAFEGO VERSION)
========================
RIDE TYPES (example):
- SafeGo Go
- SafeGo X
- SafeGo XL (7-seater)
- SafeGo Premium
- SafeGo Bike
- SafeGo CNG
- SafeGo Moto
- SafeGo Pet

FOOD:
- SafeGo Eats

PARCEL:
- SafeGo Parcel

Admin decides which services a driver is ALLOWED to use.  
Driver can only toggle inside allowed list.

========================
4. DRIVER PREFERENCES STORAGE
========================
Create new fields (ADD ONLY, do not edit or remove anything existing):

driver_profile.service_preferences = {
   ride_types: {
       safego_go: true/false,
       safego_x: true/false,
       safego_xl: true/false,
       safego_premium: true/false,
       safego_bike: true/false,
       safego_cng: true/false,
       safego_moto: true/false,
       safego_pet: true/false
   },
   food_enabled: true/false,
   parcel_enabled: true/false
}

Rules:
- If a card is tapped → toggle true/false
- Save instantly to driver_profile
- Show toast “Preferences updated”

========================
5. FILTERING LOGIC (MANDATORY)
========================
When dispatching a trip, apply:

driver must have:
- verification_status = approved  
- driver_online_status = online  
- AND service_preferences for that product = true  
- AND vehicle type matches admin requirements for that product  

Examples:
- 7-seater driver wants only SafeGo XL → only XL trips allowed.
- Bike driver turns OFF food → No food orders sent to him.
- Driver turns OFF all ride types → receives only food/parcel.

If ALL services OFF:
- Show warning toast: “Turn on a service to receive trips.”

========================
6. BACKEND BEHAVIOR (UNCHANGED)
========================
Keep:
- rides
- food_orders
- deliveries
- full status flows
- commission logic (cash vs online)
- weekly settlements
- geo filtering

Do NOT modify existing schemas. Only add service_preferences.

========================
7. SECURITY RULES
========================
- Driver cannot change admin-locked permissions.
- Customer cannot see driver service settings.
- Restaurant cannot see driver settings.
- Admin can override driver preferences from admin panel.

========================
8. UI POLISH (REQUIRED)
========================
The drawer must match the reference screenshot:
- Dark grid
- Icon centered
- Service name centered
- Clean minimal look
- Smooth tap animation
- No clutter

========================
NO QUESTIONS.  
Implement the drawer exactly as described in one build.
