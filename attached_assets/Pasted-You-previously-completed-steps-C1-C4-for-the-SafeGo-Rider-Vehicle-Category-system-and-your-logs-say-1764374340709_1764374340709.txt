You previously completed steps C1–C4 for the SafeGo Rider Vehicle Category system, and your logs say:

- C1: Core ride flow integration
- C2: Rider Vehicle Category Pricing with 7 categories (SAFEGO_X, COMFORT, COMFORT_XL, XL, BLACK, BLACK_SUV, WAV)
- C3: Driver availability indicators in the ride options screen
- C4: Accessibility and global integration, using useFareCalculation and useCategoryAvailability, and passing rideTypeCode into the ride request.

However, in the live mobile UI the rider still does NOT see any vehicle selection cards.

Current behavior (bug):

1. On the customer web app, I open the Home tab.
2. Pickup: 182 Sutter Ave, Brooklyn, NY.
3. Dropoff: any address (for example 170-21 Jamaica Ave, Queens, or even Connecticut, USA).
4. I tap "See prices".
5. The app shows the "Plan your ride" screen with:
   - Map
   - Estimated fare (single amount)
   - Route choices (Fastest, etc.)
   - "Request ride" button

But there is **no horizontal vehicle list or cards** for SafeGo X, Comfort, Comfort XL, XL, Black, Black SUV, WAV. I can’t choose a vehicle type at all. There is no carousel, no listbox, no badges – nothing visible.

What I want:

1. On the "Plan your ride" / rider options screen (the one that appears after "See prices"):
   - Directly UNDER the "Estimated fare" section and BEFORE the route choices,
   - Show a horizontally scrollable list (on mobile) of vehicle options:
     - SafeGo X
     - SafeGo Comfort
     - SafeGo Comfort XL
     - SafeGo XL
     - SafeGo Black
     - SafeGo Black SUV
     - SafeGo WAV
   - Each option must show:
     - Vehicle name
     - Price for this trip (with its own category multiplier)
     - ETA or a short label (e.g., "4–6 min")
     - Any surge / availability badges you already implemented in C3/C4.
   - One option is selected by default (SafeGo X). Tapping another card updates the selected category and fare.

2. When I tap "Request ride":
   - The selected category’s rideTypeCode must be included in the ride request payload, exactly as you described in C4.
   - Same-state NYC TLC rules and cross-state fare engine logic must continue to work as before. No regulatory or commission logic should be broken.

3. Desktop web:
   - Keep the listbox / option pattern you implemented for accessibility, but make sure at least one option is visible and clearly selectable.
   - The desktop behavior must be consistent with mobile: changing the selected vehicle updates the fare and the rideTypeCode.

4. Empty / edge cases:
   - If no drivers are available for a given category (based on useCategoryAvailability), that category card should be disabled with a clear label like “Unavailable” or “No drivers nearby”.
   - WAV must remain locked and only shown as available when your rules say so.
   - There must always be at least one selectable category as long as any driver is available in the area.

Implementation instructions:

1. Inspect the current rider options page:
   - client/src/pages/rider/ride/options.tsx (or the equivalent file you are using)
   - Check where the VehicleCategoryCard / VehicleCategoryCarousel (or similar component) is rendered.
   - If it is not rendered at all, add the component into this screen between the Estimated fare section and the route list.

2. Wiring and state:
   - Confirm that the selected vehicle category state is owned by the options page and passed into useFareCalculation so that the price on screen reflects the chosen category.
   - Confirm that when I tap a vehicle card, both:
     - selectedCategory state changes
     - rideTypeCode passed into the ride request body is updated.

3. Styling and layout:
   - For mobile: make sure the container is visible above the "Choose route" section and not hidden by overflow, display, or flex bugs.
   - Verify in the mobile preview that I can swipe the cards left/right.
   - For desktop: ensure the listbox options are visible in one column or row and clearly clickable.

4. Tests:
   - Add/update tests to cover:
     - Default selection of SAFEGO_X.
     - Switching between categories updates the fare and rideTypeCode.
     - A category with no drivers is disabled.
     - Cross-state trips still use the correct pricing when a category is selected.

When you are done:

- Restart the app, open the rider options page, and take a screenshot that clearly shows the 7 vehicle categories visible under Estimated fare.
- Summarize exactly what was changed (files, components, and important logic).
- Confirm that:
  - NYC TLC rules still apply correctly for NYC-only trips.
  - Cross-state fare engine still works.
  - Driver category preferences (driver choosing which categories to serve) are respected by dispatch.
