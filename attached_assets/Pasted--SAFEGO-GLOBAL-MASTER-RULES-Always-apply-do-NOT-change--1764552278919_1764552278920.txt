MAP RULE:
- DO NOT change the map engine, tiles, markers, or zoom controls for this task.

==================================================
TASK: Clean overlays on driver map – remove top status card + bottom legend
==================================================

GOAL:
Make the driver map screen clean like Uber:
- NO big status card on top of the map.
- NO “You / Pickup / Dropoff” legend card on bottom.
- Only footer will show online/offline status and provide the Go Online/Offline toggle.

-----------------------------
1) REMOVE TOP STATUS CARD
-----------------------------
Current:
- A white rounded card appears over the map near the top-left with:
  - Title: “You’re Offline” / “You’re Online”
  - Subtitle: “Go online to start getting trips…”
  - (Previously also had buttons/bell, etc.)

Required:
- Completely remove this entire status card component from the driver map UI.
- The map should be visible without any card overlay in that position.
- Do NOT move it somewhere else; delete it.
- Online/offline information will only be shown in the footer (center text) and controlled via the footer toggle/GO button.

Backend:
- Do NOT remove or modify the API that sets driver_online_status.
- Ensure only the footer control triggers that API.
- Make sure removing the card does NOT break any status logic.

-----------------------------
2) REMOVE BOTTOM LEGEND “You / Pickup / Dropoff”
-----------------------------
Current:
- At the bottom of the map, just above the footer, there is a row of white pill buttons:
  - “You” (green dot)
  - “Pickup” (blue dot)
  - “Dropoff” (red dot)

Required:
- Delete the entire legend container and the three pill components.
- Do NOT simply hide them with CSS; remove them so they no longer render or occupy space.
- Markers on the map (driver, pickup, dropoff) must remain as they are; only the textual legend is removed.

-----------------------------
3) KEEP FOOTER AS THE ONLY ONLINE/OFFLINE CONTROL
-----------------------------
- The footer bar at the very bottom (with Go Online/Go Offline, and left/right menus) must remain exactly as designed.
- This footer is now the ONLY UI that can:
  - Show current status text (“You’re offline” / “You’re online”).
  - Toggle driver_online_status.

Ensure:
- driver_online_status = "offline" → footer shows “Go Online”.
- driver_online_status = "online" → footer shows “Go Offline”.
- All ride/food/parcel matching logic continues to depend on driver_online_status + service_preferences.

-----------------------------
4) NON-BREAKING REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------------
- Do NOT rename or remove any fields, collections, APIs, or routes.
- Do NOT touch KYC, admin panel, commission system, or notification engine.
- This change is purely UI: remove two overlay components:
  (a) top status card
  (b) bottom “You / Pickup / Dropoff” legend.

NO QUESTIONS.  
Apply these overlay removals in a single update.
