TASK: REMOVE 3 SPECIFIC RIGHT-SIDE BUTTONS FROM DRIVER MAP UI
====================================

Screen: `/driver/map`  (driver app map screen)

The driver map currently shows multiple circular buttons on the right side:

A) At the top-right over the map:
   - A circular Notification bell button.

B) In a vertical floating stack on the right side of the map:
   1) Reload / Refresh button (curved arrow)
   2) Dollar / `$` button (earnings)
   3) Shield button (safety)
   4) Arrow button (navigation / recenter)

The user wants to REMOVE ONLY three of these buttons, and KEEP the others:

MUST REMOVE:
1) Notification bell button (the circular bell over the map on the right side)
2) Reload / Refresh button from the right-side vertical stack
3) Dollar / `$` earnings button from the right-side vertical stack

MUST KEEP:
- Shield safety button in the vertical stack
- Arrow navigation / recenter button in the vertical stack
- All footer buttons at the bottom (trip selector, Go Online, right menu)

------------------------------------
1) Remove notification bell button (map overlay)
------------------------------------
- Locate the component that renders the **circular notification bell** floating on top of the map (not the main top bar bell in the header, only the one directly over the map area).
- Completely remove its JSX from the `/driver/map` UI:
  - Do NOT just hide it with CSS (`display:none`).
  - Do NOT render an empty placeholder.
- The driver map should still work normally without that overlay button.

------------------------------------
2) Remove reload / refresh button from right-side stack
------------------------------------
- Find the vertical stack of floating action buttons on the right edge of the map.
- Identify the **reload/refresh** button in that stack (curved arrow icon).
- Remove only this specific button from the JSX.

Example pattern (to remove):

```tsx
{/* REMOVE this */}
<ReloadButton ... />
