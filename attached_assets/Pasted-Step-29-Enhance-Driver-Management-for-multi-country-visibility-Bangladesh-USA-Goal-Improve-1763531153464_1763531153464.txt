Step 29 — Enhance Driver Management for multi-country visibility (Bangladesh + USA)

Goal
Improve the existing admin “Driver Management” page so that an admin can clearly see:
- Which drivers are from Bangladesh vs USA
- Filter drivers by country without breaking any existing flows

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS
- Do NOT break or change any logic from previous steps:
  - Step 26 (Parcel Admin Management)
  - Step 27 (Bangladesh + USA driver identity fields)
  - Step 28 (driver document uploads + vehicle info)
- No destructive database migrations (no column rename/drop).
- Keep all existing security rules (RBAC, auth, input validation) exactly as they are.

High-Level Requirements
1. Show driver country clearly on the Driver Management list.
2. Add a country filter (All / Bangladesh / United States).
3. Ensure everything works with existing pagination, status filters, and verification filters.
4. Keep this change UI/API-only as much as possible, no schema redesign.

Backend Tasks
1. Reuse existing country data
   - First, re-use the existing country source already in the system:
     - Prefer the same field used for customers, e.g. user.countryCode or similar.
   - Do NOT rename or remove any existing fields.
   - If drivers currently have no reliable country field at all:
     - Add a minimal, backward-compatible country field using the same pattern as customers
       (e.g., countryCode 'BD' / 'US') with a safe default.
     - This must be an additive change only (new nullable column), no destructive actions.

2. Extend driver listing API (if needed)
   - For the admin driver list endpoint (the one powering /admin/drivers), add an optional “country” filter parameter.
     - Supported values: "ALL" (default), "BD", "US".
   - Implement filtering only when a specific country is provided; otherwise return all drivers as today.
   - Validate inputs strictly (allow only known country codes).
   - Keep existing filters (status, verification, pagination) working exactly the same.

3. Security & Validation
   - Ensure only admin-role accounts can call this API (RBAC already in place; do NOT weaken it).
   - Do not expose any new sensitive fields beyond the country code.
   - Log errors safely without leaking PII.

Frontend Tasks (Admin: /admin/drivers)
1. Country filter control
   - In the “Search & Filters” section, add a new dropdown:
     - Label: Country
     - Options:
       - All Countries (default)
       - Bangladesh (BD)
       - United States (US)
   - Bind this dropdown to the “country” filter in the driver list query.
   - Persist selection in the URL query string so that refresh/deeplink keeps the same filters.

2. Show country in the driver list
   - In each driver row/card, clearly show the driver’s country:
     - For example:
       - "BD" or "Bangladesh" for Bangladeshi drivers
       - "US" or "United States" for US drivers
   - Place it near the email and vehicle type so an admin can quickly see both identity and region.
   - Keep the existing fields (rating, trips, earnings) unchanged.

3. UI/UX polish
   - Make sure the total driver count respects the filters (e.g., “23 total” reflects current filter results).
   - When no driver matches the country filter, show an empty-state message like
     “No drivers found for the selected country and filters”.

Testing Checklist
- Admin can open /admin/drivers and see the new country filter.
- Default view (All Countries) behaves exactly like before this change.
- Selecting “Bangladesh” shows only BD drivers.
- Selecting “United States” shows only US drivers.
- Status and verification filters still work combined with the new country filter.
- No errors appear in the console or server logs for normal usage.
- Non-admin users still cannot access any admin driver endpoints or pages.

Security Phase Applied
- Phase: Admin UI & API hardening
  - RBAC preserved (admin-only).
  - No new sensitive PII fields added (only country code).
  - Inputs validated and constrained (country filter).
  - No schema or data destructive operations (only additive if needed).

Once you’re done, summarize:
- Any backend changes (endpoints/params).
- Any frontend changes (new filters, columns).
- Confirmation that all tests above passed and that the change is backward-compatible.
