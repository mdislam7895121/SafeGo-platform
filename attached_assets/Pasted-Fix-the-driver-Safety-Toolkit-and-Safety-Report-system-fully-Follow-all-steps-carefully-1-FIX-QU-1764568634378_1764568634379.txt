Fix the driver Safety Toolkit and Safety Report system fully. Follow all steps carefully:

1. FIX QUICK MESSAGE TO SUPPORT
   - The “Quick Message to Support” box in /driver/safety-emergency currently returns “Failed to Send”.
   - Implement a real working POST endpoint:
       Endpoint: POST /api/driver/support/message
       Body: { driverId, message, timestamp, location }
   - Save message into Firestore under:
       support_messages/{driverId}/messages/{autoId}
   - If saved successfully, return { status: "ok" } and show the driver a green toast: “Message sent to SafeGo Support.”
   - If error, return { status: "error" } and show red toast: “Failed to send message. Try again.”

2. FIX EMERGENCY SOS
   - The Red “Trigger Emergency SOS” button must:
       a. Save an SOS alert to Firestore:
          emergency_sos/{autoId}
       b. Include:
          { driverId, driverName, timestamp, exactLocation(lat, lng), status: "active" }
       c. Show full-screen confirmation modal: “Emergency SOS triggered. Help is on the way.”

3. ADD MISSING SAFETY REPORT PAGE
   - The route /driver/safety-report currently shows:
       “Did you forget to add the page to the router?”
   - Create this new page at: client/src/pages/driver/safety-report.tsx
   - Add correct router entry so it loads without error.
   - Page content:
       Title: “Report Safety Issue”
       Sections:
         • Choose Issue Type (dropdown)
         • Describe the issue (textarea)
         • Optional Photo Upload
         • Submit Button
   - On submit:
       Save report to Firestore under:
       safety_reports/{driverId}/reports/{autoId}
       Show success toast: “Safety report submitted.”

4. LINK ALL BUTTONS PROPERLY
   - In the driver menu, the Safety Report button must navigate to: /driver/safety-report
   - The Emergency Toolkit button goes to: /driver/safety-emergency

5. SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
   - Validate driver auth on every request.
   - Prevent empty messages or empty reports.
   - Save driver location automatically from map state.

After completing, test these:
   ✓ Emergency SOS works
   ✓ Quick Message to Support sends successfully
   ✓ /driver/safety-report opens without router error
   ✓ Safety Report can be submitted
   ✓ All toasts show correctly
