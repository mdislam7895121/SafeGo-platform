Proceed with Phase 6.

PHASE 6 – Restaurant Staff Management System (SafeGo Eats)

Requirements:
- Additive only. Do NOT modify or remove any existing fields or routes.
- Maintain full RBAC, BD/US KYC rules, and restaurant_id scoping.
- Phase 1–5 features must remain intact.
- Independent from rides and parcel modules.

Build the following:

1. Staff Management Dashboard (/restaurant/staff)
   - List all STAFF users under this restaurant_id
   - Columns: name, phone, role, status (active/blocked), last_login
   - OWNER only can access this dashboard
   - STAFF cannot see this page

2. Add Staff Flow (/restaurant/staff/new)
   - owner adds a new staff with:
     - name
     - phone
     - email
     - role: STAFF
     - temporary password
   - Staff receives notification to set permanent password
   - Must enforce BD/US KYC gating (restaurant must be verified before adding staff)

3. Staff Permissions Management (/restaurant/staff/:id)
   OWNER must be able to toggle:
   - can_edit_categories (boolean)
   - can_edit_items (boolean)
   - can_toggle_availability (boolean)
   - can_use_bulk_tools (boolean)
   - can_view_analytics (boolean)
   - can_view_payouts (view-only, no request)
   - can_manage_orders (limited)
   - staff_active (true/false)

4. Staff Activity Log
   - Track staff actions:
     - item availability change
     - menu edits (if allowed)
     - order status changes
     - payouts view attempts
   - Store logs in security_audit_log with:
     - staff_id
     - restaurant_id
     - action_type
     - timestamp
   - OWNER can view all activity logs of staff
   - STAFF cannot view logs

5. Staff Authentication Integration
   - STAFF should login using existing auth system
   - login must check:
     - role == STAFF
     - restaurant_id matches
     - staff_active == true
   - STAFF cannot access OWNER-only pages (payouts, analytics, staff dashboard)

6. Admin Panel Extensions
   - Admin can view staff list per restaurant (read-only)
   - Admin can block/unblock staff
   - Admin can audit staff actions globally
   - No admin editing of staff permissions (OWNER only)

7. Security
   - Strict RBAC on all endpoints
   - No cross-restaurant access
   - OWNER can manage STAFF only within same restaurant_id
   - All create/update/delete actions logged in audit log

Backend Endpoints (add-only):
- GET /api/restaurant/staff
- POST /api/restaurant/staff
- GET /api/restaurant/staff/:id
- PATCH /api/restaurant/staff/:id
- POST /api/restaurant/staff/:id/block
- GET /api/restaurant/staff/activity-log

Frontend:
- Staff list page
- Staff create form
- Staff edit/permissions page
- Activity log viewer

Finish full Phase 6 before moving to Phase 7.
