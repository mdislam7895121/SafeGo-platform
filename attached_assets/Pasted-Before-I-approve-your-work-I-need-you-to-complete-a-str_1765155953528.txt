Before I approve your work, I need you to complete a strict SafeGo Master Rules compliance review.  
You MUST run through each point below and confirm, fix, or adjust anything that is missing.

==============================================
A) VEHICLE TYPE LOGIC (MUST CONFIRM)
==============================================

Confirm:
1. Delivery vehicle options = bicycle, motorbike, car.
2. Selecting “car” sets:
   - vehicle_type = "car"
   - can_food_delivery = true
   - can_parcel_delivery = true
   - can_ride = false  (must stay false)
3. No conflict with existing ride-driver onboarding.
4. No forced enabling of car ride-hailing.

==============================================
B) CAR DELIVERY DOCUMENT RULES (MUST CONFIRM)
==============================================

For USA (delivery driver, vehicle_type = "car"):
- REQUIRED:
  - driver_license_number
  - driver_license_front_image
  - driver_license_back_image
  - driver_license_expiry
  - car_registration_document
  - car_insurance_document
  - car_inspection_document (if relevant)

- OPTIONAL (NYC only):
  - tlc_license_number
  - tlc_license_front_image
  - tlc_license_back_image
  - tlc_vehicle_docs
  - MUST have visible “Skip for now” or similar control.

- FHV Number MUST NOT appear.

For BD (vehicle_type = "car"):
- Required: registration + insurance + fitness/inspection (if implemented)
- TLC must not appear for BD.

==============================================
C) DELIVERY DRIVER DASHBOARD (MUST CONFIRM)
==============================================

For delivery-only drivers:
- Sidebar MUST include:
  - Active Delivery
  - Food Deliveries
  - Delivery History
  - Wallet
  - Incentives
  - Trust Score
  - Log Out

- Sidebar MUST NOT include:
  - Active Trip
  - Trip History (ride)
  - Ride map elements

==============================================
D) MATCHING ENGINE (MUST CONFIRM)
==============================================

Delivery-only drivers (any vehicle: bicycle, motorbike, car):
- MUST receive only:
  - food_orders
  - deliveries

- MUST NOT receive:
  - rides

Ride-only drivers must not receive food/delivery orders unless admin enables service flags.

==============================================
E) STATUS FLOW + ONLINE LOGIC (MUST CONFIRM)
==============================================

Delivery drivers:
- Go Online must check:
  - is_verified = true
  - verification_status = "approved"

If NOT approved:
- Show “Your documents are under review”
- Must NOT allow going online.

==============================================
F) COUNTRY BRANCHING (MUST CONFIRM)
==============================================

- USA delivery car drivers see USA docs only.
- BD delivery car drivers see BD docs only.
- TLC sections appear ONLY for USA + NYC zone.
- All TLC fields optional.

==============================================
G) NON-BREAKING RULES (MUST CONFIRM)
==============================================

You must verify:
- No existing ride-driver flows were modified or broken.
- No DB field renamed or deleted.
- All functionality was added as extensions, not replacements.
- All routes continue working.

==============================================
H) FINAL CHECK
==============================================

After verifying A–G, give me a summary:
- What is correct
- What needed fixing
- What was updated
- What remains open (if anything)

ONLY after this review will I approve the Car delivery flow.
