You are updating the SafeGo Rider Web App.

Follow ALL existing SafeGo rules:
- Do NOT change any backend or business logic (location search, geocoding, autofill, ride creation, pricing, promos, commission, matching, KYC).
- Only update the UI layout and styling for the pickup/dropoff address bars on the rider “Plan your ride” page.
- Security: no new external calls, no extra logging of PII. Pure front-end refactor.

Goal:
Make the pickup + dropoff address bars look professional and Uber-grade on both desktop and mobile, while keeping all current functionality.

Scope:
- Page: `client/src/pages/rider/ride-request.tsx` (or equivalent)
- Components: the header area that renders the “Plan your ride” section and the two address inputs.

--------------------------------
1. Extract a dedicated header component
--------------------------------
1. Locate the JSX that renders:
   - The “Plan your ride” title
   - The pickup address field
   - The dropoff address field

2. Extract this into a reusable component, e.g.:
   - `RideAddressHeader` in `client/src/components/rider/RideAddressHeader.tsx`

3. The new component must receive all logic as props:
   - `pickupAddress`, `dropoffAddress`
   - `onPickupChange`, `onDropoffChange`
   - `onSwapAddresses` (if already implemented)
   - `onPickupFocus`, `onDropoffFocus` (if used for suggestions)
   - Do NOT re-implement business logic inside this component; only call the existing handlers.

4. Replace the old inline JSX in `ride-request.tsx` with the new `<RideAddressHeader ... />` while keeping all props and handlers wired the same way.

--------------------------------
2. Card container design (both desktop + mobile)
--------------------------------
Update `RideAddressHeader` container styling to be a clean card:

- Full-width on mobile, constrained within the left panel on desktop (respect existing layout).
- Use a white card with:
  - background: `#FFFFFF`
  - border: `1px solid #E5E7EB`
  - border-radius: `16px`
  - box-shadow: `0 6px 18px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)` (very soft)
  - padding: `16px` on all sides
  - vertical spacing between internal rows: `12px`

Inside the card:

- Top row: a small title text:
  - Label: `Plan your ride`
  - Font weight: 600
  - Font size: 0.9rem
  - Color: neutral gray (`#111827`)

--------------------------------
3. Professional input rows (Pickup & Dropoff)
--------------------------------
For each address (pickup and dropoff), render a structured row instead of a plain input:

Layout:
- A flex row:
  - Left: circular icon
  - Middle: label + address text
  - Right: optional swap button (only on the pickup row, see below)

Details:

1. Left icon:
   - 32x32 circle
   - Pickup:
     - Background: `#EFF6FF` (soft blue)
     - Icon: a small solid marker or letter `A` in `#2563EB`
   - Dropoff:
     - Background: `#FEF2F2` (soft red)
     - Icon: a small solid marker or letter `B` in `#DC2626`

2. Text block (middle):
   - Two lines stacked vertically:
     - Line 1: label
       - Pickup row: `Pickup`
       - Dropoff row: `Dropoff`
       - Style: uppercase or small caps, `font-size: 0.75rem`, `font-weight: 500`, color `#6B7280`
     - Line 2: address value
       - Show the current address string.
       - Style: `font-size: 0.95rem–1rem`, `font-weight: 500`, color `#111827`
       - If the address is too long, truncate with ellipsis: single line only.

   - The entire text block acts as the click / focus target:
     - On click or tap, focus the underlying input and open autocomplete.

3. Underlying input:
   - Keep a real `<input>` or `<textarea>` but make it visually minimal:
     - `opacity: 0` or width/height 0 but accessible via label, OR
     - Use a positioned input with no border/background.
   - The main visual representation is the formatted text block above.
   - Ensure accessibility (screen readers can still see the label + value).

--------------------------------
4. Swap button between Pickup and Dropoff
--------------------------------
If swap functionality already exists, wire it into the UI; if not, only add the button skeleton that calls the existing handler when available.

Design:
- On the right side of the pickup row (desktop and mobile), place a small circular icon button:
  - 32x32 size
  - Background: `#F3F4F6`
  - Icon: vertical arrows `⇅` or a standard “swap” icon
  - Tooltip / aria-label: `Swap pickup and dropoff`
- Clicking/tapping triggers `onSwapAddresses` passed from parent.
- Do NOT create new business logic; rely on the existing handler or no-op if not provided.

--------------------------------
5. Mobile-specific layout tweaks
--------------------------------
On mobile viewports (< 768px):

- The `RideAddressHeader` card should be full-width with:
  - `margin-inline: 12px`
  - `margin-top: 8px`
  - `margin-bottom: 8px`
- Each address row should have:
  - Vertical padding: `10–12px`
  - A thin divider (`<hr>`) between pickup and dropoff rows with color `#E5E7EB`
- Ensure the map remains clearly visible under the card:
  - Do NOT let the address card grow excessively tall.
  - If an address is extremely long, truncate with ellipsis.

Focus states:
- When pickup or dropoff is active:
  - Add a subtle border highlight around that row (`border: 1px solid #2563EB`, `border-radius: 12px`, `background: #EFF6FF` for pickup, `#FEF2F2` for dropoff).
  - Keep padding consistent so the layout doesn’t “jump”.

--------------------------------
6. Desktop layout preservation
--------------------------------
For desktop/tablet viewports (>= 768px):

- Keep the existing overall two-column layout of the ride request page:
  - Left: Plan your ride + promo + rides list
  - Right: Map
- The new `RideAddressHeader` must fit into the left column exactly where the old address block was.
- Do NOT change:
  - Map position or size
  - Ride cards panel structure
  - Promo banner behaviour

Only the internal look & feel of the address card is updated.

--------------------------------
7. Behaviour & autocomplete
--------------------------------
- Do NOT change any of the following:
  - How address search is performed
  - When API calls are made to the geocoding service
  - How location suggestions are rendered
  - Any validation or error handling logic

- You may adjust the suggestion dropdown styling so that:
  - It anchors to the active row (pickup or dropoff).
  - It does not overflow off-screen on mobile.
  - It has a white background, border, and shadow matching the card.

--------------------------------
8. Testing checklist
--------------------------------
After implementing:

1. Desktop:
   - Enter pickup and dropoff.
   - Confirm:
     - Address bars show new visuals (icons + labels + truncated text).
     - Suggestion dropdown still works.
     - Swapping (if available) still works.
     - No layout regression to the map or ride list.

2. Mobile (use device preview):
   - Open the ride request page.
   - Check:
     - Card spacing looks clean; it does not feel cluttered.
     - Pickup/Dropoff labels are readable.
     - Long addresses appear truncated with ellipsis, not wrapping into 3–4 lines.
     - Tapping opens suggestions and focus states correctly.
     - The rest of the page (promo, rides list, Request ride button) is unchanged except for improved spacing around the header.

3. Ensure there are no console errors and all existing tests still pass.

Document in a short comment at the top of `RideAddressHeader.tsx` what this component does and that it is UI-only (no business logic inside).
