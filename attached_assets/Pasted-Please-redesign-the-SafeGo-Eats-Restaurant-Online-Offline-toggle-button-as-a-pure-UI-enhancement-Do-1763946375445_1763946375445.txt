Please redesign the SafeGo Eats Restaurant Online/Offline toggle button as a pure UI enhancement. Do NOT change any backend logic, routing, APIs, or KYC rules. Keep all SafeGuard rules fully enforced. This must be visually improved only.

CONTEXT:
This toggle controls whether the restaurant is accepting orders. It currently sits under the restaurant header. We want a clearer, larger, more touch-friendly button that matches the design spec below.

COMPONENT TO UPDATE:
- Update the existing component that renders the Online/Offline toggle in the restaurant portal header (for example: /client/src/pages/restaurant/components/OnlineStatusToggle.tsx or equivalent). Do not rename the component or move it to a different file.

PLACEMENT:
- The button must remain in the restaurant header area, centered under the restaurant identity block:
    Line 1: SafeGo Eats brand and navigation
    Line 2: Restaurant name, verified badge, ID, location
    Line 3: NEW Online/Offline pill toggle (centered horizontally)
    Line 4: Search bar
- Do not change the alignment of other header elements. No layout shifts beyond what is required to fit the new toggle.

FULL REDESIGN SPECIFICATION:

1. OVERALL SIZE & SHAPE
   - Height: 46px
   - Border-radius: 9999px (pill / capsule)
   - Horizontal padding: 20px on left and right
   - Ensure minimum tap target: at least 44px in both dimensions on mobile

2. ICON & LABEL
   - Use a power icon (on/off) inside the button.
   - Icon size: 22px
   - Space between icon and label text: 12px
   - Label text: "Online" when active, "Offline" when inactive
   - Label font size: 15–16px, medium/semibold weight
   - Use high contrast colors for accessibility.

3. COLOR STATES

   ONLINE STATE:
   - Background: #0CCE6B (SafeGo Green)
   - Text color: #FFFFFF
   - Icon color: #FFFFFF
   - No border
   - Add a subtle glow or soft box-shadow to indicate active status.
   - Example: box-shadow: 0 0 12px rgba(12, 206, 107, 0.5)

   OFFLINE STATE:
   - Background: #E5E7EB (neutral gray)
   - Text color: #374151 (dark gray)
   - Icon color: #374151
   - Border: 1px solid #D1D5DB
   - No glow in offline state.

4. INTERACTION & ACCESSIBILITY
   - Use role="switch" on the button element.
   - aria-checked must reflect the current online state: true when Online, false when Offline.
   - Keep all existing click handlers and state wiring; only wrap them in the new UI.
   - Keyboard support:
       - Button must be focusable via Tab.
       - Pressing Enter or Space should toggle the state (using the existing handler).
   - Focus ring:
       - When focused, show a 2px outline around the pill:
         outline: 2px solid #4B9EFF;
         outline-offset: 3px;
   - Add smooth transitions (150–200ms) on:
       - background-color
       - color
       - box-shadow
       - a very light scale transform on press/active (for example, scale(0.98) while active)

5. RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR
   - The button must look good on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
   - The pill width may grow or shrink with content, but:
       - Text must never wrap onto a second line.
       - Icon and label must stay on a single row.
   - Center the button horizontally in its header row on all breakpoints.
   - Ensure the new button does not push the search bar or other elements out of place. If needed, adjust only local spacing within the header container.

6. DO NOT DO
   - Do NOT change the logic that decides whether the restaurant is online or offline.
   - Do NOT change any API calls or backend behavior.
   - Do NOT modify routing or URLs.
   - Do NOT rename files or exported component names.
   - Do NOT alter KYC or verification gating. If the restaurant cannot go online due to missing KYC or business docs, keep the existing logic exactly as-is.
   - Do NOT change any other parts of the restaurant dashboard layout beyond the minimal spacing needed around this button.

7. AFTER IMPLEMENTATION, PLEASE VERIFY
   - Test the toggle on:
       - Desktop
       - Tablet (dev tools responsive mode)
       - Mobile width
   - Confirm:
       - Click/tap toggles the state correctly.
       - Keyboard (Tab + Enter/Space) toggles the state correctly.
       - Focus ring appears correctly and is clearly visible.
       - No text wrapping inside the button.
       - Surrounding header and dashboard cards do not shift or break.
   - Take and save a screenshot of the new toggle in ONLINE state on mobile viewport and desktop viewport.
   - Confirm that all previous pages that show this header (dashboard, orders, menu management, staff management, payouts, documents, support) still render correctly with no regressions.

This task is strictly a visual and accessibility enhancement of the Online/Offline toggle button for the SafeGo Eats restaurant portal. Keep all existing business rules, APIs, and security/SafeGuard constraints fully intact.
