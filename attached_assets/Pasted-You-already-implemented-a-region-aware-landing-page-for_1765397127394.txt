You already implemented a region-aware landing page for Bangladesh / United States / Global. Now I need you to extend the same region-awareness to the contact / help center page so that **only Bangladesh** shows support options for **Local Shops** and **Tickets & Travel**, because these services are not available in the United States or Global regions.

Goals:

1) Region-aware contact categories
2) Region-aware “Contact Our Teams” cards
3) No changes for United States and Global (they must remain exactly as they are now)

Details:

A. Contact form category dropdown (Bangladesh only)

On the `/contact` page there is a “Send Us a Message” form with:
- Full Name
- Email Address
- Category (select dropdown)
- Message

Right now the Category dropdown includes these options (or similar):
- General Inquiry
- Rides & Transportation
- Food Delivery
- Parcel Delivery
- Driver/Courier Support
- Business Partnership
- Payments & Billing
- Safety Concern
- Technical Issue
- Other

I want this dropdown to become **region-aware** like the landing page.

1. Introduce a configuration object, for example:

   ```ts
   const CONTACT_CATEGORY_CONFIG = {
     bangladesh: [
       "General Inquiry",
       "Rides & Transportation",
       "Food Delivery",
       "Parcel Delivery",
       "Local Shops",
       "Tickets & Travel",
       "Driver/Courier Support",
       "Business Partnership",
       "Payments & Billing",
       "Safety Concern",
       "Technical Issue",
       "Other",
     ],
     united_states: [
       "General Inquiry",
       "Rides & Transportation",
       "Food Delivery",
       "Parcel Delivery",
       "Driver/Courier Support",
       "Business Partnership",
       "Payments & Billing",
       "Safety Concern",
       "Technical Issue",
       "Other",
     ],
     global: [
       "General Inquiry",
       "Rides & Transportation",
       "Food Delivery",
       "Parcel Delivery",
       "Driver/Courier Support",
       "Business Partnership",
       "Payments & Billing",
       "Safety Concern",
       "Technical Issue",
       "Other",
     ],
   } as const;
