Step 36 – Add DMV Inspection section for all USA drivers (admin driver details + KYC + documents)

Goal:
Extend the USA driver vehicle information with a dedicated "DMV Inspection" section that is shown for all USA drivers. This must not break any existing Bangladesh or USA functionality, and must reuse existing secure file upload and access-control patterns.

Scope:
1) Data model (non-breaking, optional fields)
2) KYC form updates for USA drivers
3) Admin Driver Details page layout (new DMV Inspection block)
4) Admin Document Review integration
5) Security & backward compatibility checks

1. Data Model – DMV Inspection (USA only)
Use the existing USA vehicle/driver entities and add new optional fields (NO breaking schema changes):

- For the USA vehicle entity (e.g. VehicleUS or equivalent), add nullable fields:
  - dmvInspectionType: string | null       // e.g. "Safety", "Emissions", "Safety + Emissions"
  - dmvInspectionDate: Date | null
  - dmvInspectionExpiry: Date | null
  - dmvInspectionImageUrl: string | null   // stored path of the uploaded inspection document
  - dmvInspectionStatus: enum | string | null
    - Allowed values: "valid", "expired", "missing"
    - Default: "missing" when no inspection data is available

These fields must be:
- Optional (nullable) so legacy USA drivers continue to work
- Scoped only to USA vehicles; NO impact on Bangladesh identity/vehicle data

2. KYC Forms – USA Drivers
Update the USA driver KYC / vehicle section so that DMV Inspection data can be captured:

- In the USA driver KYC form (driver app or web KYC), add a new DMV Inspection block:
  - DMV Inspection Type: dropdown (Safety, Emissions, Safety + Emissions, Other)
  - Inspection Date: date picker
  - Inspection Expiry Date: date picker
  - Upload Inspection Document: file upload (image or PDF) – REQUIRED for USA drivers
- Validation rules:
  - For any USA driver, DMV Inspection document upload is required before KYC can be marked as fully Verified.
  - If inspection expiry date is in the past, mark status as "expired".
  - If inspection document is missing, mark status as "missing".
  - If inspection document exists and expiry is in the future, mark status as "valid".

Note:
- Do NOT change any Bangladesh KYC forms.
- Reuse existing secure file upload endpoints and storage configuration that are already used for license images / documents.

3. Admin Driver Details Page – New DMV Inspection Section
On the Admin Driver Details page for USA drivers:

- Under the existing "Vehicle Information" block (after the Insurance Document section), add a visual divider and then a new block:

  Title: "DMV Inspection"

  Fields to display:
  - Inspection Type
  - Inspection Date
  - Inspection Expiry
  - Status (Valid / Expired / Missing)
  - Inspection Document: show either:
    - a small thumbnail with "View Document" link
    - or the text "Missing" in red if no document is available

- Status & warnings:
  - If Status = "missing":
      Show a red warning banner:
      "DMV inspection document is missing. Please request the driver to upload a valid inspection document."
  - If Status = "expired":
      Show a red warning banner:
      "DMV inspection has expired. Please verify and request updated inspection documents."
  - If Status = "valid":
      No warning; show normal status.

- Layout rules:
  - Emergency Contact section should remain above Vehicle Information (as already planned).
  - The DMV Inspection block must appear as part of the Vehicle Information area, below registration and insurance information.
  - For non-USA or Bangladesh-only drivers, hide the DMV Inspection block entirely.

4. Admin Document Review – DMV Inspection
Update the Admin Document Review page so DMV Inspection appears along with other documents for USA drivers:

- In the USA driver document review modal:
  - Add a "DMV Inspection" subsection under vehicle-related documents.
  - Show:
    - Inspection Document thumbnail / link
    - Inspection Date
    - Inspection Expiry
    - Current Status (valid / expired / missing)
  - Admin actions:
    - Approve / Reject DMV Inspection as part of the overall document approval.
    - If rejected, show a short note to the driver (reuse the existing rejection reason mechanism).

- For Bangladesh drivers, do NOT show any DMV Inspection section.

5. Security & Privacy
- Reuse the existing secure file upload mechanism used for license documents:
  - Authenticated upload only
  - Files must not be publicly accessible without proper authorization
- Access control:
  - Only admins can view DMV Inspection documents in the admin panel.
  - Drivers can only see their own inspection status/docs on their own profile (if that UI exists).
- No sensitive PII beyond what is already allowed for documents; DMV Inspection image is treated as a standard legal document.
- Ensure no inspection data or URLs are leaked to unauthorized users (respect existing RBAC).

6. Backward Compatibility & Tests
- All new fields must be optional so that:
  - Existing USA drivers without DMV Inspection data still load without crashing.
  - Bangladesh drivers are not affected.
- Testing checklist:
  - USA driver with complete DMV Inspection:
    - Driver details page shows DMV Inspection block with "valid" status.
    - Document Review shows the inspection document correctly.
  - USA driver without DMV Inspection:
    - Status "missing" with red warning banner.
    - No runtime errors.
  - USA driver with past expiry date:
    - Status "expired" and warning banner shown.
  - Bangladesh driver:
    - No DMV Inspection block visible anywhere.
  - No regressions in:
    - Driver list
    - Country / state filters (including New York state filter)
    - Existing license + TLC document uploads
    - Wallet / settlement flows

Important:
- Do NOT modify or remove any existing Bangladesh/USA identity fields, DMV license fields, TLC license fields, or vehicle registration/insurance behavior from previous steps.
- The change must be strictly additive and non-breaking.
