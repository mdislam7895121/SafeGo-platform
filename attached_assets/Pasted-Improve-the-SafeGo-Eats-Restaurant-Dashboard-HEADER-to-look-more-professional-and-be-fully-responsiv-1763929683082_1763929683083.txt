Improve the SafeGo Eats Restaurant Dashboard HEADER to look more professional and be fully responsive (mobile, tablet, laptop, desktop), without breaking any existing functionality or routes.

GOAL:
Create a clean, modern, Uber Eats–style restaurant header that:
- Clearly shows restaurant identity and verification
- Groups controls logically on the right
- Works well on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Remains fully compatible with all current SafeGo rules (RBAC, KYC, 3 services, admin panel, etc.)

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:

1) Layout Structure (Desktop / Large Screens)
- Use a 3-part layout:
  LEFT:
    • SafeGo Eats logo/brand
    • Restaurant name (e.g., "mohammad")
    • Verification badge ("Verified & Active")
    • Subtext: location status (e.g., "Location pending") in muted text
  CENTER:
    • Global search bar (search orders, menu items, customers, etc.)
  RIGHT:
    • Restaurant status pill: "Open" / "Closed" (colored pill, e.g., green for Open, red for Closed)
    • "You're receiving orders" toggle (clearly labeled)
    • Notifications icon with badge
    • (Optional) Help icon
    • Profile avatar / initials dropdown (MO) with logout

- Ensure proper spacing and alignment using flexbox/grid.
- Use consistent typography and sizes with the rest of the app.
- Add data-testid attributes for all important header elements.

2) Layout Structure (Mobile and Tablet)

Mobile (small screens):
- Row 1:
    • Left: SafeGo Eats logo + short restaurant name
    • Right: notifications icon + profile avatar
- Row 2:
    • Full-width search bar
- Row 3:
    • Status pill ("Open"/"Closed") + "Receiving orders" toggle
- Below:
    • Small text for "Verified & Active" badge and "Location pending" or location info.

Tablet (medium screens):
- Combine into a compact 2-row header:
    • Top: logo + restaurant name + verification on the left, controls (status pill, toggle, notifications, profile) on the right.
    • Bottom: full-width search bar.

- Use Tailwind/utility classes with responsive breakpoints (sm, md, lg) to switch between layouts.
- Make sure the header height is not too tall on mobile; keep it compact.

3) Behaviour and UX
- Status pill:
    • Clearly shows "Open" vs "Closed"
    • Colors must be accessible (AA contrast)
- "You're receiving orders" toggle:
    • Add tooltip: e.g., "Pause receiving new orders" when hovering or long-pressing
- Notifications:
    • Badge shows unread count
- Profile avatar:
    • Opens existing profile/account menu (do not change routes or behaviour)

4) Implementation Constraints
- Do NOT change any backend logic, routes, APIs, or database schemas.
- Do NOT alter RBAC or KYC checks.
- All changes must be additive and non-breaking.
- Keep existing status flows for orders, rides, and deliveries unchanged.
- Ensure the new header works across:
    • Restaurant Dashboard
    • Orders pages (Live Orders, Order History, etc.)
    • Menu Management, Promotions, Payouts & Finance, and all other restaurant routes.

5) Testing
- Verify header layout on:
    • Mobile viewport
    • Tablet viewport
    • Laptop / desktop viewport
- Add or update data-testid attributes for:
    • header container
    • restaurant name
    • verification badge
    • status pill
    • receiving-orders toggle
    • notifications icon
    • profile avatar
    • search bar
- Ensure there are no layout regressions on existing restaurant pages.

After implementing, give me a short summary of:
- Which components/files were changed
- How the header behaves in mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Confirmation that there are no breaking changes to any restaurant, customer, driver, admin, rides, food_orders, or deliveries flows.
