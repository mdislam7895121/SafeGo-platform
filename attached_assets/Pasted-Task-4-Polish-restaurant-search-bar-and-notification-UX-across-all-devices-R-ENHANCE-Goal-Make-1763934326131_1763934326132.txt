Task 4 - Polish restaurant search bar and notification UX across all devices (R-ENHANCE)

Goal:
Make the SafeGo Eats restaurant portal search bar and notification experience feel production-quality on desktop, tablet, and mobile, without breaking any existing backend APIs, RBAC/KYC rules, or other phases. This is part of the R-ENHANCE pack (Task 4).

High-level requirements:
1) Refine the global restaurant search bar (header).
2) Improve the notification bell UX and dropdown.
3) Add useful, realistic placeholder behaviors everywhere that is not fully implemented yet (no “Coming Soon” feel for search/notifications).
4) Preserve all existing security (RBAC, KYC gating, audit logging) and backend contracts.
5) Keep changes incremental and non-breaking, with clear documentation in replit.md.

Scope:
- Only restaurant portal (SafeGo Eats) pages.
- Primarily header layout and any shared search/notification components used in restaurant pages (dashboard, orders, menu, payouts, staff, analytics, settings, documents, support).
- Frontend-only for this task. Do NOT modify Prisma schema, backend services, or routes.

Step 1 – Identify and refine search + notification components:
1. Locate the current components used for:
   - Restaurant header layout (SafeGo Eats header bar).
   - Search input (the bar that searches orders/menu/customers).
   - Notification bell and dropdown.
2. Centralize them if not already:
   - Extract shared logic into reusable components (e.g., RestaurantSearchBar, RestaurantNotificationBell) if they are fragmented.
   - Ensure these components are used consistently on all restaurant pages that render the main header.

Step 2 – Search bar UX polish:
Implement the following behaviors and visual refinements:

A. Core interaction:
- Typing in the search bar should:
  - Show a dropdown panel under the search bar.
  - Debounce input to avoid excessive re-renders (e.g., 250–300ms).
- Add a visible “clear” icon/button inside the input when there is text:
  - Clicking it clears the query and hides results/empty state.
- Support keyboard shortcuts:
  - Pressing "/" focuses the search input (if not currently typing in another field).
  - Pressing "Ctrl+K" (or "Cmd+K" on macOS) also focuses the search input.
  - Ensure shortcuts are only active on pages where the main restaurant header is present.

B. Suggestions & structured results (frontend only, safe placeholders):
Implement a structured suggestion panel when the user types, with these sections:

1) Recent searches
   - Show up to 5 recent queries the user typed.
   - Store recent searches in client state only (e.g., local state or localStorage).
   - Each item is clickable and re-runs that query.

2) Orders
   - Show a small list of “orders” results (use existing data if there is an API, otherwise use safe mock placeholder entries).
   - Display: order ID, short label (e.g., “Order #1234 – 2 items”), and status pill.
   - Clicking navigates to the appropriate order detail page or keeps it as a stub link if that page is not implemented (but never throws errors).

3) Customers
   - Show a small list of customers (name + masked phone/email).
   - Clicking opens customer-related view if available or a safe placeholder action.

4) Menu items
   - Show matching menu items by name and category (use existing list if accessible, or mock entries if not).
   - Clicking should navigate to the menu item edit page or open a safe placeholder.

Each section should:
- Have a clear section label (“Recent searches”, “Orders”, “Customers”, “Menu items”).
- Hide the section when there are no results.
- Use consistent, compact, and readable styling that fits the current design system.

C. Empty and error states:
Add polished states inside the dropdown:
- Empty: “No results found. Try a different keyword.”
- Loading: “Searching…” if you implement any async behavior.
- Error-safe: If any fetch or mapping fails, show a generic safe message instead of crashing. Never expose internal errors to the UI.

D. Layout & responsiveness:
- On desktop:
  - Search bar remains inline with the header, width balanced to avoid overflow.
- On tablet:
  - If necessary, allow the search bar to grow below the top header while still visually connected.
- On mobile:
  - Search bar should be full-width under the top header row.
  - Make sure it is easily tappable and does not cause horizontal scroll.
- Ensure:
  - No horizontal scroll at any breakpoint due to the search bar or its dropdown.
  - All clickable elements meet minimum 44px tap target height.

E. Accessibility:
- Add/verify aria-labels:
  - Search input (e.g., aria-label="Search orders, menu items, and customers").
  - Clear button (e.g., aria-label="Clear search").
- Keyboard navigation:
  - Tab/Shift+Tab moves between search input and dropdown items.
  - Enter selects the highlighted item.
  - Esc closes the dropdown and leaves focus in the search bar.

Step 3 – Notification bell & dropdown polish:
Refine the notification experience as follows:

A. Visual styling:
- Keep the bell icon in the header (top right).
- Show a small badge with unread count (capped, e.g., “9+”).
- Styling must match the updated header (Uber Eats–style professional look already implemented in Task 1).

B. Dropdown behavior:
- On click:
  - Open a dropdown panel aligned with the bell icon.
  - Show a list of notifications: type icon, short title, one-line description, relative time (e.g., “2 min ago”).
- Support basic categories:
  - Orders (new orders, cancellations, modifications).
  - Payouts (payout sent, failed, needs verification).
  - Account (KYC reminders, document expiry, health & safety reminders).
- If no real notifications exist, show a friendly empty state:
  - “You’re all caught up. No new notifications.”
- Clicking outside closes the dropdown.
- Pressing Esc closes the dropdown.

C. Keyboard and accessibility:
- The bell should be focusable via keyboard.
- Pressing Enter/Space toggles the dropdown.
- Add aria attributes like:
  - aria-expanded, aria-controls on the bell icon.
  - role="menu" / role="menuitem" or suitable roles on dropdown and list items.

D. Data-safety:
- If real notification data is available from the backend, use it.
- If not, use clearly placeholder-safe content that does not leak internal IDs or debugging info.
- Never expose raw JSON or internal IDs directly in the UI beyond what is already exposed elsewhere in the portal.

Step 4 – General layout cleanup related to search/notifications:
While implementing the above, ensure that:
- Header layout does not break the rest of the page content.
- The search bar and notifications align consistently with the restaurant name, status capsules, and “You’re receiving orders” capsule button.
- All breakpoints (desktop, tablet, mobile) show clean alignment and spacing, with no overlapping elements.

Step 5 – Testing and data-testid attributes:
1. Add or update data-testid attributes for automated testing:
   - Search input, clear button, dropdown container, each section (recent, orders, customers, menu items), each notification item, notification bell, notification badge, and the dropdown close behavior.
2. Manually test:
   - Desktop: standard laptop width (~1366px).
   - Tablet: around 768–1024px.
   - Mobile: 375–430px.
3. Confirm:
   - No runtime errors in the console.
   - No horizontal scroll appears due to the new components.
   - Shortcuts ("/", Ctrl+K/Cmd+K) behave correctly.
   - Search and notification dropdowns work across all tested pages.

Step 6 – Security and backend safety checks:
- Do NOT change:
  - Prisma schema
  - Database migrations
  - Backend routes or guards
  - RBAC roles and KYC gating
- Ensure the search and notifications components do not bypass any existing access-control logic.
- All new props and hooks must be type-safe with TypeScript.

Step 7 – Documentation in replit.md:
At the end of this task:
- Update replit.md with a “R-ENHANCE Task 4 – Search + Notification UX Polish” section including:
  - Files touched.
  - Summary of UX improvements for search.
  - Summary of notification improvements.
  - Any known limitations or placeholders (e.g., where mock data is used for now).
  - Notes confirming no backend or RBAC changes were made.

Acceptance criteria:
- Search bar:
  - Works with clear button, keyboard shortcuts, suggestions, and proper empty states.
  - Is fully responsive on desktop, tablet, and mobile, with no horizontal scroll.
- Notifications:
  - Bell opens a clean dropdown with readable list items and proper empty state.
  - Keyboard and click interactions work as expected.
- No runtime errors in the console.
- No breaking changes to backend, RBAC, or KYC.
- replit.md updated with a clear description of the work.
