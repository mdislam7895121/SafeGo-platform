You are finalizing SafeGo’s admin-side enterprise tooling.

Follow core rules:
- Safe separation between dev, staging, and production.
- No destructive deployment actions directly from untrusted UIs.
- All environment changes must be logged and require explicit confirmation.

TASK GOAL  
Create an **Environment Promotion & Publish Readiness Console** so that senior admins can:
- see the status of each environment (dev/staging/prod)
- confirm checklists before publishing
- track who approved a release to move forward

REQUIREMENTS  

1. Release & Environment Model
   - Add `ReleaseVersion`:
     - id, versionTag (e.g. “v1.0.3”), description, createdAt, createdByAdminId.
   - Add `ReleaseEnvironmentStatus`:
     - id, releaseId, environment (DEV, STAGING, PROD)
     - status (NOT_DEPLOYED, DEPLOYED, VERIFIED, ROLLED_BACK)
     - checklistStatus (PENDING, PASSED, FAILED)
     - lastUpdatedByAdminId, lastUpdatedAt.

2. Readiness Checklists
   - For each environment, define checklist items (hardcoded or data-driven) such as:
     - Automated tests passed
     - Security audit completed
     - KYC & compliance configs verified for BD and US
     - Backup snapshot taken before deploy
     - Rollback plan documented
   - Store checklist results and who marked them completed.

3. Environment Console UI
   - New sidebar entry: “Releases & Publish”.
   - Main view:
     - Table of releases with version tag, description, and status indicators for DEV/STAGING/PROD.
   - Detail view for a release:
     - Per-environment cards showing status and checklist.
     - Buttons:
       - “Mark deployed to Staging”
       - “Mark verified in Staging”
       - “Mark deployed to Production”
       - “Mark rolled back”
     - All actions are purely state tracking; they do NOT perform actual deployment but reflect real-world operations.

4. Permissions & Approvals
   - Only `RELEASE_ADMIN` or `SUPER_ADMIN` can update release statuses.
   - Optionally allow a “two-step approval”:
     - One admin proposes promotion; another admin approves.
     - Design data model with fields `proposedBy`, `approvedBy`.

5. Audit & History
   - Every state change writes an audit log:
     - releaseId, environment, oldStatus, newStatus, adminId, timestamp, optional comment.
   - Provide a simple history panel in the UI to review past changes.

6. Integration with Existing Docs
   - Link to existing `PHASE2_REPORT`, `PHASE3_REPORT`, etc., from the release detail page so admins can quickly check what’s included.
   - Show warnings if there are open critical issues in the Operations Console or Security Center before allowing a “Production verified” status.

Deliver the full implementation (backend models, routes, and admin UI) so SafeGo’s leadership can manage releases and prove that publish decisions followed a structured, auditable process.
