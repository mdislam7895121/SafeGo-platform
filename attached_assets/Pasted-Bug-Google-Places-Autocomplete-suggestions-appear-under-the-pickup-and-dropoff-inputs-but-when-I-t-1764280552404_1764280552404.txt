Bug: Google Places Autocomplete suggestions appear under the pickup and dropoff inputs, but when I tap/click a suggestion, the text field does NOT update with the full address. It only keeps whatever I typed manually, and the selected place is not stored.

Please audit and fix the location search implementation so that selecting a suggestion correctly fills the input and updates the selected location.

What I am seeing:
- Suggestions like “188 Sutter Avenue …” or “170-21 Jamaica Avenue …” show in the dropdown (powered by Google).
- When I click/tap one of those suggestions, the input field still shows only my partial text (e.g., “188 sutter ave” or “170-21 j”), not the full formatted address.
- The app then behaves as if no location was selected.

What I need:
1. When a user selects a suggestion (via mouse click or touch), the input field MUST update to the full suggestion description (e.g., “188 Sutter Avenue, Brooklyn, NY, USA”).
2. The selected place must be stored in state with:
   - full formatted address
   - place_id
   - coordinates (lat, lng), resolved via Google Places Details or the JS SDK.
3. The dropdown should close after selection.
4. Both pickup and destination fields (current location and “Where to?”) must use the same fixed behavior.

Implementation details:
- We are using the Google Maps JavaScript SDK with Places Autocomplete, loaded client-side using the key from `/api/maps/config`.
- Please review and, if needed, update these files (names may differ, adjust accordingly):
  - `client/src/components/rider/LocationSearchInput.tsx`
  - `client/src/hooks/useGoogleMaps.ts`
  - `client/src/lib/locationService.ts`
  - Any component that renders the current location and destination search fields on the customer home/ride screen.
- Make sure the component is a controlled React input:
  - The input `value` reflects the currently selected address.
  - There is a clear handler like `onPlaceSelect` or `handleSuggestionClick` that:
    - receives the selected suggestion (from Google Autocomplete),
    - updates React state with full address + place_id + lat/lng,
    - calls back to the parent (e.g., `onChangeLocation` / `onLocationSelected`) so the rest of the ride booking flow knows which place was chosen.
- Also support keyboard interactions:
  - Pressing Enter on a highlighted suggestion should behave the same as clicking it.

Acceptance tests:
- Type “188 Sutter Ave” in the pickup field, click a suggestion:
  - The input should change to the full formatted address from Google.
  - No console errors.
- Type “170-21 J” in the destination field, select one of the suggestions:
  - The input shows the full selected address.
  - The internal location object contains place_id and coordinates.
- After both pickup and destination are selected, the app should be ready to compute distance/route without any “empty location” issues.

Please implement the fixes, restart the app, and then report back exactly what changed (which files and what logic), and confirm with screenshots or logs that the selection now works.
