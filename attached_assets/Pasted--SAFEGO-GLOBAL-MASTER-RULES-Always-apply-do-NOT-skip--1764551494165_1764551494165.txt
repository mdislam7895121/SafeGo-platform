====================================================
TASK: Remove duplicate Go Online button and legend card
====================================================

Goal:
- On the driver map screen, there must be ONLY ONE Go Online/Go Offline control (in the footer).
- Remove the old upper Go Online button from the status card.
- Remove the “You | Pickup | Dropoff” legend card at the bottom of the map.
- Keep all backend logic and matching rules unchanged.

----------------------------------
1) REMOVE TOP GO ONLINE BUTTON
----------------------------------
Current issue:
- The driver status card at the top of the map shows:
  “You’re Offline / Go online to start getting trips…” PLUS an extra Go Online button.

Required change:
- Inside the status card, remove the Go Online/Go Offline button completely.
- The status card should only display:
  - status title: “You’re Online” / “You’re Offline”
  - subtitle: “Go online to start getting trips…” (or online variant)
- All online/offline toggling must now be controlled ONLY by the footer control (or GO button if already implemented).

Backend logic:
- Do NOT remove or change the existing API for setting driver_online_status.
- Reuse the same endpoint from the footer toggle.
- Ensure the removed top button no longer triggers any calls.

----------------------------------
2) REMOVE “You | Pickup | Dropoff” LEGEND CARD
----------------------------------
Current issue:
- At the bottom of the map there is a pill-style legend card showing:
  “You     Pickup     Dropoff”.

Required change:
- Remove this entire legend card component from the driver map screen.
- Do NOT remove or change the underlying markers on the map (driver marker, pickup, dropoff).
- Only the UI legend pill should be removed.

----------------------------------
3) FOOTER ONLINE/OFFLINE CONTROL (KEEP)
----------------------------------
- Keep the footer bar exactly as designed:
  - Center: single Go Online / Go Offline control (pill or GO button, depending on current implementation).
  - This is now the ONLY way for the driver to switch online/offline.
- Ensure:
  - driver_online_status="online" → footer shows “Go Offline”.
  - driver_online_status="offline" → footer shows “Go Online”.
- Keep all matching logic for rides/food_orders/deliveries tied to driver_online_status and service_preferences.

----------------------------------
4) NON-BREAKING REQUIREMENTS
----------------------------------
- Do NOT rename or remove any database fields, collections, routes, or APIs.
- Only:
  - remove the top status-card button UI,
  - remove the legend pill UI,
  - keep footer control and backend logic intact.
- Map visual behavior (markers, zoom, movement) must stay exactly the same.

NO QUESTIONS.  
Apply exactly these UI removals in a single build without touching existing business logic.
