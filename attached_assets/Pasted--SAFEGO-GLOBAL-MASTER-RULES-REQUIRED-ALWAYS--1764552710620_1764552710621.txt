SAFEGO GLOBAL MASTER RULES (REQUIRED ALWAYS)
==========================================

(Keep all previous rules: 4 roles, global logic for rides/food/parcel, BD & US KYC, admin panel, verification flow, collections, commission rules, wallet rules, payout rules, security rules, status flows, notifications, onboarding steps, etc. DO NOT modify any backend logic.)

NO CHANGES to map engine, map markers, routing, footer, trip selector, or current trip panel.

==================================================
TASK: Remove ALL extra map overlay UI from driver map
==================================================

On the driver map screen (/driver/map), completely REMOVE the following three UI components:

-------------------------------------
1) REMOVE LEGEND PILL GROUP (bottom)
-------------------------------------
Remove the horizontal pill group containing:
- “You” (green dot)
- “Pickup” (blue dot)
- “Dropoff” (red dot)

Delete the entire component. Do NOT hide with CSS.

-------------------------------------------
2) REMOVE “Powered by SafeGo” MAP WATERMARK
-------------------------------------------
At the bottom-right, remove the small pill/button that shows “Powered by SafeGo”.
Delete it entirely.

-----------------------------------------------
3) REMOVE BLUE “SafeGo Map – Live Navigation” BANNER
-----------------------------------------------
At the top-left of the map, remove the blue banner:
- Icon + “SafeGo Map”
- Subtitle “Live Navigation”

Delete this banner completely so the map remains clean.

------------------------------------------------
KEEP EVERYTHING ELSE EXACTLY AS IT IS:
------------------------------------------------
- Map tiles, zoom buttons, FAB controls → unchanged
- Driver marker, pickup marker, dropoff marker → unchanged
- Footer bar with online/offline toggle → unchanged
- Left menu drawer → unchanged
- Right menu drawer → unchanged
- No changes to backend, collections, KYC, verification, admin panel.

This task is ONLY UI cleanup.

NO QUESTIONS. Apply all removals in a single update.
