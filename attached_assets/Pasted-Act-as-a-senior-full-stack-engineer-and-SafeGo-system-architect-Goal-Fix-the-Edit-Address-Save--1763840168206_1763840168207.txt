Act as a senior full-stack engineer and SafeGo system architect.

Goal: Fix the "Edit Address" Save Address button so that it properly updates the driver profile and returns to Account Settings. The UI is already built; only the wiring and behavior need to work correctly.

Context:
- Current route: /driver/account/address (Edit Address screen)
- Entry point: Account Settings → Address tile → Edit Address page
- Form fields:
  - streetAddress
  - city
  - state
  - zipCode
- After entering address and tapping "Save Address", nothing happens (no API call, no redirect, no error message).

Follow all existing SafeGo conventions and rules:
- Roles: customer, driver, restaurant, admin (do not break any other role flows).
- Keep all existing KYC, payouts, tax info, vehicles, and documents untouched.
- Do not touch ride, food, or parcel booking flows.
- Do not break any existing URLs or navigation patterns.
- Keep security rules: authenticated driver only, server-side validation, no trust on client, no leaking of other users’ data.

Implementation tasks (do all of these):

1) Wire up the form submit
- Locate the Edit Address React/TSX component used for /driver/account/address.
- Ensure there is a real onSubmit handler on the form and onClick handler on the "Save Address" button.
- Prevent double submit and show a loading state while saving.

2) Call the correct backend API
- Reuse the existing driver profile update endpoint if it already exists (for example: PATCH /api/driver/profile or similar).
- If there is a dedicated address update endpoint, use that instead. Do NOT invent a new route name if a standard one already exists.
- Send a payload like:
  {
    streetAddress: string,
    city: string,
    state: string,
    zipCode: string
  }
- Use the currently logged-in driver id from the existing auth/session layer. Never trust any id coming from the client.

3) Validation rules
- Client-side: basic required validation for all fields.
- Zip/postal code:
  - For US drivers: 5-digit numeric ZIP only for now (simple validation).
  - For all other countries: allow any non-empty string (do not block international use).
- If validation fails, show inline error messages under the corresponding field and do NOT call the API.

4) Server-side validation and security
- On the server, ensure:
  - The request is authenticated as a driver.
  - The driver can only update their own address (match user id from session/token).
  - Use a schema (Zod or existing validation utilities) to validate streetAddress, city, state, zipCode.
- Log the address change in an audit log table if SafeGo already uses one for profile changes.
- Do not expose any other driver’s data in the response.

5) Success behavior
- On successful update:
  - Show a success toast/banner: “Address updated successfully.”
  - Navigate back to /driver/account.
  - On the Account Settings screen, show the updated address preview if that UI exists.
- Make sure the back navigation from the Edit Address page still works normally.

6) Error handling
- If the API returns a validation error, show those messages on the form.
- If there is a network or server error, show a generic, safe message: “Unable to update address right now. Please try again later.”
- Never show raw stack traces or internal error details.

7) Testing and verification
- Test with:
  - A US driver (NY address) and verify:
    - The address actually changes in the database/profile model.
    - Refreshing /driver/account shows the new address.
  - A non-US driver (e.g., Bangladesh) to ensure non-US zip/postal codes are accepted.
- Confirm that:
  - No other Account Settings sections are broken (Documents, Vehicles, Tax Info, Map Settings, etc.).
  - Driver Profile, Wallet, SafeGo Points, and Opportunity continue to work as before.

Deliverables:
- Updated Edit Address page with a fully working Save Address flow.
- Any necessary backend changes (controller, route, validation) to support updating the driver’s address securely.
- Brief summary in the Agent log of what was changed (files, APIs, and how to roll back if needed).
