Follow all SafeGo Master Rules and implement D10: Driver Getting Started Page (Web Version).

GOAL:
Create a complete Driver “Getting Started / Onboarding Checklist” page under route /driver/getting-started that matches Uber’s professional onboarding style and works on mobile and desktop. This page must show the full driver onboarding progress, list all required steps, show statuses, and allow the driver to continue each pending item.

REQUIREMENTS:

1) ROUTE
Create and connect route:
- /driver/getting-started
- Sidebar item: “Getting Started”
- Must open this new page.

2) PAGE HEADER
Add:
- Title: “Getting Started”
- Subtitle: “Complete these steps to begin driving with SafeGo.”
- Hero-style welcome section with subtle background.

3) PROGRESS SUMMARY
Add a progress bar and summary:
- “X of 12 steps completed”
- Auto-calculated from the checklist items
- Large progress bar at top

4) CHECKLIST ITEMS (All Web UI Only)
Add the following items exactly, each as a card with:

  - Training → /driver/tutorials
  - Background Check → /driver/background-check

8) SECURITY RULES
- Do not expose raw PII
