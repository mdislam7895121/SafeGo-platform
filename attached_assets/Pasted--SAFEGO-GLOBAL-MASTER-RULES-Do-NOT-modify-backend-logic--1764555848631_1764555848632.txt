=============================
SAFEGO GLOBAL MASTER RULES
(Do NOT modify backend logic)
=============================

ROLES (4 distinct roles)
- customer, driver, restaurant, admin

SERVICES (all required)
- ride-hailing, food delivery, parcel delivery

KYC (country-specific, must stay)
- BD: father_name, date_of_birth, present_address, permanent_address,
      nid_number, nid_front_image, nid_back_image,
      emergency_contact, verification_status, is_verified
- US: date_of_birth, home_address, emergency_contact,
      government_id_type, government_id_last4,
      driver_license_number + image + expiry (drivers),
      ssn_last4 (optional, drivers),
      verification_status, is_verified

ONBOARDING
- multi-step: basic info → address → ID/KYC upload → emergency contact
- set verification_status="pending" and block services until admin approves

ADMIN PANEL (keep all)
- verify customers/drivers/restaurants (approve/reject + rejection_reason)
- block/unblock any user/restaurant
- configure pricing/fees/commissions
- manage payouts; view driver negative balance; view restaurant negative balance

CORE COLLECTIONS (no schema changes)
- rides, food_orders, deliveries:
  - identity fields (customer_id, driver_id, restaurant_id…)
  - addresses + geolocation
  - fees + safego_commission
  - payment details
  - timestamps
  - full status flows
  - rating & feedback

COMMISSION RULES (keep)
- cash ride: driver gets cash, commission → negative driver_wallet_balance, weekly settlement
- cash food: restaurant gets cash, commission → negative restaurant_wallet
- online: SafeGo keeps commission automatically
- admin can mark balances settled

SECURITY
- customers can’t see driver docs
- drivers can’t see customer KYC
- restaurants can’t see other restaurants
- only admin can change pricing/commission/verification/blocking
- users edit only their own profile

STATUS FLOWS
- rides: requested → searching_driver → accepted → driver_arriving → in_progress → completed / cancelled_x
- food_orders: placed → accepted → preparing → ready_for_pickup → picked_up → on_the_way → delivered / cancelled_x
- deliveries: requested → searching_driver → accepted → picked_up → on_the_way → delivered / cancelled_x

NOTIFICATIONS
- trip/order alerts, status updates, verification decisions, payout reminders, admin notices

MAP
- do NOT change map tiles/engine, zoom, or markers.

=====================================================
TASK: Fix floating footer button positions on /driver/map
=====================================================

Goal:
- We have 3 floating controls on top of the map:
  1) LEFT  : trip-type selector button
  2) CENTER: Go Online/Go Offline button
  3) RIGHT : current-trip/menu button

Currently:
- The right button has moved to the left, overlapping the other button, and both dropped too low.

We must:
- place each button in its correct corner/center,
- keep them on the same horizontal line,
- and prevent overlap.

-----------------------------------
1) Ensure correct positioning context
-----------------------------------
- In the map content wrapper (the container to the right of the sidebar), set:
    position: relative;
- The 3 floating buttons must be children of this wrapper so that all positions are relative to the map area, not the whole window.

-----------------------------------
2) CENTER button (Go Online / Go Offline)
-----------------------------------
- Must be perfectly centered horizontally ABOVE the bottom of the MAP area.

CSS / style for center button:
- position: absolute;
- bottom: 16px;
- left: 50%;
- transform: translateX(-50%);
- z-index: high enough to float above the map controls.

Do NOT change its logic or colors:
- offline → green background, label "Go Online"
- online → red background, label "Go Offline"

-----------------------------------
3) LEFT button (trip type selector)
-----------------------------------
- Must sit at the bottom-left of the map.

CSS / style:
- position: absolute;
- bottom: 16px;
- left: 16px;
- z-index: same layer as center button.

Do NOT change click behavior (it should still open the trip-type selector drawer).

-----------------------------------
4) RIGHT button (current trip / menu)
-----------------------------------
- Must sit at the bottom-right of the map (it should NOT move to the left).

CSS / style:
- position: absolute;
- bottom: 16px;
- right: 16px;
- z-index: same layer as center button.

Do NOT change its click behavior (it opens current trip info).

-----------------------------------
5) Prevent overlap and vertical drift
-----------------------------------
- All three buttons must use the SAME bottom offset (bottom: 16px) so they align on a single horizontal line.
- Do NOT use margins that push them further down off-screen.
- There must be NO extra wrapper that repositions the right button to the left (remove any flex layout that is grouping left + right into one container).
- Each button should be absolutely positioned independently (left, center, right).

-----------------------------------
6) No other changes
-----------------------------------
- Do NOT create or remove any backend fields or APIs.
- Do NOT touch KYC, admin, commission, status, or map logic.
- Only fix the position of these 3 buttons so they appear as:

   [ LEFT button ]        [ Go Online ]        [ RIGHT button ]

all on one line near the bottom of the map, with no overlap.

NO QUESTIONS. Apply exactly these layout fixes.
