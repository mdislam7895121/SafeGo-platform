You are the lead engineer of the SafeGo project. Follow ALL existing SafeGo rules and do NOT break the working Ride or Parcel flows.

====================
SECTION A – CONTEXT
====================
- Route `/customer` exists with a top service toggle: Ride / Eats / Parcel.
- When the user selects **Eats**, the screen only shows a placeholder:
  - Title: "SafeGo Eats"
  - Subtitle: "Order from nearby restaurants"
  - Text: "Coming soon..."
- However, the SafeGo Eats implementation is already present and tested:
  - Restaurant list & restaurant details (e.g. `food-restaurants.tsx`, `food-restaurant-details.tsx`).
  - Menu & item selection with "Add to Cart" buttons.
  - Cart context + checkout (quantities, remove, address, payment, tip).
  - Order placement using `food_orders`.
  - Order tracking page with status timeline, map & ETA.
  - Activity / history shows food orders.
- Goal: CONNECT this existing Eats implementation to the `/customer` home so that the user can actually browse restaurants and place orders from the Eats tab, instead of seeing "Coming soon…".

====================
SECTION B – GLOBAL SAFEG0 RULES (SUMMARY)
====================
Apply these while changing code:
1. Roles: customer, driver, restaurant, admin – do not break role-based routing or visibility.
2. Shared collections: `rides`, `food_orders`, `deliveries`, `users`, `drivers`, `restaurants`, `payouts`, `disputes`, `notifications`.
3. Status flows:
   - Eats: PLACED → ACCEPTED_BY_RESTAURANT → PREPARING → READY_FOR_PICKUP → PICKED_UP → NEARBY → DELIVERED → CANCELLED.
4. Security:
   - All customer Eats pages behind Auth / ProtectedRoute.
   - All API calls use `apiRequest` wrapper.
   - Use existing Zod/input validation patterns.
   - Do not leak other users’ data or internal fields.
5. KYC:
   - Browsing restaurants allowed without full KYC.
   - Placing a food order requires KYC = verified, otherwise show clear message and link to KYC screen.
6. Navigation:
   - Bottom tabs (Home, Activity, Wallet, Profile) must continue to work for Ride, Eats, Parcel.
   - Top account menu (Profile, Wallet, Home, Activity, Help, Logout) must keep working in all modes.

====================
SECTION C – IMPLEMENTATION TASKS
====================

1. Find the placeholder for "SafeGo Eats – Coming soon…"
- Locate the file that renders the customer booking layout and the service toggle for Ride/Eats/Parcel. This is likely named something like:
  - `unified-booking.tsx`, `customer-booking.tsx`, or the page component for `/customer`.
- Inside this file there will be logic similar to:
  - `if (serviceType === 'ride') { ... }`
  - `if (serviceType === 'eats') { return <ComingSoon ... /> }`
  - `if (serviceType === 'parcel') { ... }`
- Replace the Eats branch so it no longer renders the placeholder.

2. Create or reuse a proper Eats home component
- If a suitable component already exists (for example `FoodHome`, `EatsHome`, or a restaurant-list screen), reuse it.
- If not, create a small wrapper component (for example `CustomerEatsHome`) that:
  - Fetches and displays the restaurant list (using the existing restaurant list logic, NOT new mock data).
  - Shows cuisine filters and favorites entry if those features are implemented.
  - Provides a visible entry to the cart (cart badge/button) that opens the existing checkout/cart screen.

3. Wire the Eats tab to the real Eats flow
- When the customer is on `/customer` and selects **Eats**:
  - Show the new `CustomerEatsHome` instead of the "Coming soon" placeholder.
  - Clicking a restaurant card should navigate to the existing restaurant details page (the one that already shows menu items and “Add to Cart” buttons).
- Ensure that:
  - Back navigation (in-app back + browser back) returns from restaurant details to the Eats home restaurant list.
  - The Ride and Parcel layouts are not changed.

4. Cart + checkout integration
- Ensure the existing `CartContext` is used from the Eats home and details pages:
  - Adding an item via “Add to Cart” updates the cart and shows the toast.
  - Adding from a different restaurant triggers the confirmation dialog that clears the old cart and adds the new item.
- Provide a clear way to open the cart/checkout from the Eats UI:
  - Either a “View Cart” button or an icon in the header that routes to the combined checkout page you already implemented.
- At checkout:
  - Customer can adjust quantities and remove items.
  - Delivery address selection uses the same address/geo validation as before.
  - Payment method selection uses the existing payment/wallet method.
  - Tip field works if it was already implemented.
- Enforce KYC requirement before allowing “Place order”.

5. Order placement and tracking
- Confirm that pressing “Place order” from the Eats checkout:
  - Creates a `food_orders` entry using the existing model and status enum.
  - Redirects the user to the real-time food order tracking page you implemented (status timeline + map + ETA).
- Confirm that Activity / History shows the new order and can open its details.

6. Cleanup and UI polish
- Remove or retire the placeholder “Coming soon…” component so it is not reachable in the customer flow.
- Make sure the header (logo, service toggle, audio, notifications, profile avatar) still renders exactly as before on `/customer`.
- Do NOT break the Ride or Parcel flows.

====================
SECTION D – QA CHECKLIST (MUST RUN & FIX)
====================
After your changes, manually test and fix any issues until all of these pass:

1) Navigation:
- `/customer` opens in Ride mode as before.
- Switching to Eats shows restaurant list instead of “Coming soon”.
- Switching back to Ride shows the ride booking UI correctly.

2) Restaurant → cart → checkout:
- From Eats home:
  - Open a restaurant, add items, see cart badge update.
  - Switch restaurants, see confirmation dialog and correct cart behavior.
  - Open checkout, adjust quantities, set address & payment & tip.
  - Place order (with KYC verified) with no console errors.

3) Tracking & history:
- After placing an order, you see the real-time tracking page with:
  - Status timeline based on the Eats status enum.
  - Live map and ETA.
- Activity / History lists this order; opening it shows correct details.

4) Auth & logout:
- If logged out, trying to access any Eats checkout or tracking route redirects to login (ProtectedRoute).
- Logging out via the top menu logs the user out from all customer services and prevents re-opening `/customer` until login.

Finally, update your Agent report with:
- The file(s) you changed.
- How to test the customer Eats flow from `/customer` step by step.
- Any remaining limitations or TODOs.

Start implementing these changes now and stop only when the Eats tab on `/customer` is fully functional and no longer shows the "Coming soon" placeholder.
