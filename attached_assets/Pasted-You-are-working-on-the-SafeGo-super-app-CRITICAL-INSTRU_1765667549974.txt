You are working on the SafeGo super app.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS (READ CAREFULLY):
- This is a FINAL, ONE-SHOT task. No partial work.
- Do NOT ask follow-up questions.
- Do NOT mark anything complete unless it is actually verified working.
- Audit the ENTIRE system end-to-end and fix ALL issues.
- Treat this as a pre-production launch audit.

====================================================
SAFEGO GLOBAL RULES (MANDATORY)
====================================================

1. There is ONE shared SafeGo backend.
   - Pricing, GPS, ride status, food, parcel, auth, country rules must all come from this backend.
   - No frontend-only logic for pricing, maps, or status.

2. Customer app (/customer) is a LANDING EXPERIENCE.
   - Ride, Eats, Parcel must all work from this entry point.

3. Signup Rule:
   - ONLY customer signup exists.
   - Drivers, restaurants, partners are created later via onboarding.
   - Never break existing roles.

4. Country Logic:
   - USA and Bangladesh must both work.
   - Currency, payment methods, vehicles, availability must come from backend.

5. Production Security:
   - In production (NODE_ENV=production), app MUST FAIL TO START if any required secret is missing.
   - No temporary keys allowed in production.
   - Required secrets:
     JWT_SECRET
     ENCRYPTION_KEY
     SESSION_SECRET
     DATABASE_URL
     GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY

6. Google Maps Rules:
   - Singleton loader ONLY.
   - No duplicate script tags.
   - ResizeObserver must trigger map resize.
   - Proper cleanup on unmount.
   - Must work on mobile + desktop without broken tiles.

====================================================
YOUR TASKS (ALL REQUIRED)
====================================================

A. FULL SYSTEM AUDIT
- Ride flow (pickup, dropoff, routes, pricing, vehicles)
- Eats flow (restaurant list, filters, empty state, menus)
- Parcel flow
- Authentication + sessions
- Database connections (NO duplicate pools)
- WebSockets (no leaks, proper limits)
- Memory usage (no unbounded growth)

B. FIX EVERYTHING FOUND
- Fix broken UI states
- Fix missing data issues (seed demo data if required)
- Fix map rendering issues
- Fix backend bugs
- Fix security gaps

C. PRODUCTION HARDENING
- Enforce strict environment validation
- Remove ALL hardcoded or fallback secrets
- Ensure production fails fast on misconfiguration

D. VERIFY — NOT ASSUME
You MUST provide proof for each:
- Browser console logs
- Server logs
- Clear explanation of what was tested and how

E. FINAL DELIVERABLE (MANDATORY)
At the end, output a FINAL REPORT with these exact sections:

1. AUDIT SUMMARY (PASS / FAIL)
2. ISSUES FOUND (bullet list)
3. FIXES APPLIED (file names + what changed)
4. VERIFIED WORKING (Ride / Eats / Parcel / Maps / Auth)
5. PRODUCTION READINESS STATUS
6. KNOWN NON-BLOCKING ISSUES (if any)
7. CLEAR NEXT STEPS (if any)

If ANYTHING is not production-ready, mark the audit as FAIL.

====================================================
IMPORTANT
====================================================

- Do NOT say “ready” unless everything is truly working.
- Do NOT skip any module.
- Do NOT leave TODOs.
- This output will be used as a final decision for production launch.

Begin the audit now.
