ROLE: Final QA Gatekeeper + Release Authority for SafeGo

THIS IS A HARD STOP CHECK.
You are NOT allowed to say “ready” unless every item below is PROVEN.

ABSOLUTE RULES:
- No assumptions.
- No summaries without evidence.
- No “appears to be working”.
- If even ONE item fails → mark status = NOT READY.
- Do NOT ask me questions. Test and decide.

SCOPE:
Customer-facing app only.
Routes:
- /customer
- /customer/ride
- /customer/eats
- /customer/parcel

DEVICES:
- Desktop (>=1280px)
- Mobile (<=390px)

========================
PHASE 1: PAGE-BY-PAGE FUNCTIONAL PROOF
========================

For EACH route, do ALL checks and report PASS/FAIL explicitly.

1) /customer (Home)
- Service cards visible
- Ride / Eats / Parcel navigation works
- No layout break on resize
- No console errors
Result: PASS/FAIL

2) /customer/ride
- Google Map loads on first render
- Map tiles correct after resize
- Pickup autocomplete works
- Dropoff autocomplete works
- Selecting pickup + dropoff updates state
- Ride options appear
- No stuck loading state
Result: PASS/FAIL

3) /customer/eats
- Restaurants visible (not empty unless intentionally empty)
- Cuisine filter works
- Search works
- Restaurant card opens
- Empty state only shown when DB truly empty
Result: PASS/FAIL

4) /customer/parcel
- Pickup location selectable
- Dropoff location selectable
- No TS/runtime errors
- Submit flow proceeds correctly
Result: PASS/FAIL

========================
PHASE 2: TECHNICAL SANITY CHECKS
========================

- No blocking console errors on any page
- No infinite loading
- Session persists on refresh
- Protected routes redirect correctly
- Google Maps script loaded once only
- No memory growth when navigating between pages

Each item must be explicitly confirmed.

========================
PHASE 3: PROOF ARTIFACTS (MANDATORY)
========================

You MUST provide:
- Console log snippets (clean state)
- API response example for Eats list
- Exact files changed (if any) during this phase
- Confirmation that NO new features were added

========================
FINAL OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT)
========================

ROUTE STATUS:
- /customer: PASS/FAIL
- /customer/ride: PASS/FAIL
- /customer/eats: PASS/FAIL
- /customer/parcel: PASS/FAIL

BLOCKERS:
- List exact blockers or write: NONE

DECISION:
- GO (Ready for deployment)
OR
- NO-GO (Explain why)

If ALL routes = PASS and blockers = NONE,
end with this exact line only:
"FINAL STATUS: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT"

Otherwise:
"FINAL STATUS: NOT READY"

BEGIN NOW.
