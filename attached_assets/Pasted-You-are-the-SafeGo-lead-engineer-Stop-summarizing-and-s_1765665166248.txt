You are the SafeGo lead engineer. Stop summarizing and start fixing. No partial fixes. No “it should work”. You must deliver a publish-ready system with hard checks and a fixed map UI.

NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES
1) Do not invent keys. Do not generate fake secrets in production.
2) If any required production secret is missing, the app must FAIL FAST with a clear FATAL message.
3) After fixes, you must provide proof: file paths + code snippets + the exact logs/console evidence showing it works.

====================================================
A) SECRETS + PRODUCTION ENFORCEMENT (HARD REQUIREMENT)
====================================================

Problem: After moving from personal -> team, some secrets are missing in the TEAM/PRODUCTION environment, which causes runtime breakage and unstable deploys.

Tasks:
1) Create a single source of truth for required secrets:
   - Add/Update docs/SECRETS_CHECKLIST.md
   - List every secret used by backend and frontend, with:
     (name, required: dev/prod, where used, what breaks if missing)

2) Implement an Environment Guard that enforces:
   - In NODE_ENV=production:
     REQUIRED: JWT_SECRET, ENCRYPTION_KEY, SESSION_SECRET, GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY, DATABASE_URL (or PGHOST/PGPORT/PGUSER/PGPASSWORD)
     Also required if payments are enabled in prod: SSLCOMMERZ_STORE_ID_BD, SSLCOMMERZ_STORE_PASSWORD_BD
     If any missing/invalid -> process exits immediately with [FATAL] and a readable list of missing keys.

   - In development:
     Warn clearly, but allow app to run ONLY where safe.
     Never generate temporary keys in production.

3) Replit Secrets audit:
   - Compare current secrets in TEAM project against the checklist.
   - For any missing secret: STOP and ask the owner to provide the value.
   - Do not proceed to “Publish ready” until the owner confirms all required values are set.

Acceptance criteria (must meet all):
- In production without JWT_SECRET/ENCRYPTION_KEY -> app refuses to start with FATAL message.
- In production with all secrets -> app starts cleanly (no secret-related warnings).
- Checklist matches actual usage in code (no “extra” or “forgotten” secrets).

====================================================
B) GOOGLE MAPS “BROKEN TILES / WHITE BLOCKS” FIX (CRITICAL)
====================================================

Problem seen in screenshots:
- Map loads with broken/partial tiles (white blocks, mis-rendered tiles).
This is usually caused by container sizing, hidden parent layout, missing height, or no resize trigger after layout changes.

Tasks:
1) Ensure map container has stable sizing:
   - The map wrapper MUST have explicit height/width.
   - Avoid rendering map in a container that starts hidden or has height: 0.
   - Ensure responsive rules for desktop + mobile.

2) Force correct map resize behavior:
   - Add a ResizeObserver on the map container.
   - On size change, call:
     google.maps.event.trigger(map, "resize")
     and re-fit bounds if needed.

3) Prevent duplicate map instances:
   - Ensure the Google Maps script loads once.
   - Ensure map instance is created once per page lifecycle and cleaned up on unmount.
   - No memory leaks, no multiple overlays fighting each other.

4) Verify API key + services:
   - Confirm Maps JavaScript API + Places API are enabled.
   - Add clear runtime logging for “Maps script loaded”, “Map instance created”, “Places ready”.
   - If key restricted, ensure correct HTTP referrers for:
     - replit.app domain
     - custom domain (safegoglobal.com)
     - any preview domain used

5) Failure UX:
   - If map fails to load, show a clean fallback panel (not blank space).
   - Show a single banner: “Map unavailable. Check configuration.” with a retry button.

Acceptance criteria (must meet all):
- Desktop: map tiles render fully, no broken squares after refresh.
- Mobile: map tiles render fully, no broken squares after scrolling/route selection.
- After switching tabs/sections or resizing window: map still renders correctly.
- No console errors related to map init or container size.

====================================================
C) DELIVERABLES (YOU MUST OUTPUT THESE)
====================================================

1) List of missing secrets (names only) that the owner must provide.
2) Exact files changed (paths) + brief reason per file.
3) Proof:
   - A screenshot or copied logs showing Environment Guard behavior in production mode
   - A screenshot or statement showing the map is fixed on both desktop and mobile.

If you cannot complete a requirement, say exactly why and what input you need from the owner. Do not claim “fixed” without proof.
