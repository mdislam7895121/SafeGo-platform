Follow all SafeGo Master Rules and complete this entire task in one uninterrupted full implementation.

TASK: Make the Driver Promotions & Bonuses page fully professional like Uber.  
Complete the entire system end-to-end (frontend + backend).  
Use the UI/UX sketch below exactly as the visual/functional blueprint.

REQUIRED OUTCOME:
1. Fix date strip interactions (swipe/tap must work perfectly)
2. Load promotions by exact date selection
3. Show different promotions for different days (day-by-day)
4. Admin-created promotions must correctly map to selected date(s)
5. Build professional promotion cards like Uber (layout exactly as sketch)
6. Implement empty states, sticky headers, progress bars, and reward summaries
7. No UI breaking, no scrolling reset, no page reloads
8. Completely maintain all SafeGo rules and do not break any existing flows

API REQUIREMENTS:
- GET /api/driver/promotions?date=YYYY-MM-DD  
  Should return only the promotions active on that specific day.
- Support both single-date and date-range promotions from admin.
- Map admin promotions to driver dates dynamically.

FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS:
- Date pills: swipeable, tappable, animated selection, dynamic fetch
- Promotions list: Uber-style cards, scrollable, responsive
- Daily header: “Monday, Nov 24”
- Card components:
  • Title
  • Badge (Quest / Bonus / Opportunity)
  • Time + location line
  • Description (2–3 lines then truncate)
  • Thumbnail (image placeholder)
  • Earnings summary (e.g., “Earn up to $40 extra”)
  • Quest progress (text or bar)
- Empty state for days with no promotions

STRICT RULES:
- Do not break restaurant, customer, or driver flows
- No schema changes unless absolutely required (and explain why)
- Keep all existing components functional
- Must test with multiple dates before finishing
- Perform full implementation in one pass
