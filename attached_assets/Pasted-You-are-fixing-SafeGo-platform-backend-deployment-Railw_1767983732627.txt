You are fixing SafeGo-platform backend deployment (Railway) currently returning 502 on /api/health.

Observed facts from logs/screens:
- Prisma migration deploy completed with “No pending migrations to apply”
- Still 502 on https://safego-platform-production.up.railway.app/api/health
- Deploy logs show Prisma errors around audit logging:
  - “Invalid prisma.auditLog.create() invocation”
  - “The table public.audit_logs does not exist in the current database”
So the app is crashing on request because audit logging is required but the audit_logs table is missing (or model mismatch).

Goal:
1) Make the service respond (no 502) immediately.
2) Fix Prisma schema + DB so audit logging works without crashing.
3) Keep changes minimal and production-safe.

Do the following EXACT steps:

A) Confirm schema contains AuditLog model
- Open prisma/schema.prisma
- Verify there is a model named AuditLog (or the model used by prisma.auditLog)
- If the model name is different, identify the exact prisma client call used in code (e.g., prisma.auditLog.create) and ensure a matching model exists.

B) Fix the database by creating the missing table via Prisma migration
- If AuditLog model exists but DB table missing:
  1) Create a new migration that adds the audit_logs table (or correct mapped name) using Prisma Migrate.
  2) Ensure the table name matches what Prisma expects. If the model uses @@map("audit_logs") or @map, keep it consistent.
  3) Deploy migration to Railway DB.

Commands (run in project root):
- npx prisma generate
- npx prisma migrate dev --name add_audit_logs_table  (if dev command is allowed in this environment)
  If dev is not allowed, then:
- npx prisma migrate diff --from-schema-datamodel prisma/schema.prisma --to-schema-datasource prisma/schema.prisma --script > prisma/migrations/manual_add_audit_logs.sql
- Apply SQL safely to the Railway Postgres (use Railway SQL console) and then mark migration as applied with:
  - npx prisma migrate resolve --applied <MIGRATION_FOLDER_NAME>

Important:
- Do NOT drop existing data.
- Do NOT reset or wipe the database.
- If database already contains a similar table, align schema to it instead of recreating.

C) Add a production safety guard so missing audit table can’t crash the app again
- In the audit logging helper (where prisma.auditLog.create is called), wrap with try/catch:
  - If audit insert fails, log a warning and continue.
  - This must not crash the request.
Example:
  try { await prisma.auditLog.create({ data: ... }) }
  catch (e) { console.warn("AuditLog write failed", e?.message || e) }

Also allow an env toggle:
- If process.env.DISABLE_AUDIT === "true", skip audit writes entirely.

D) Set Railway env vars correctly
- Ensure DATABASE_URL is the Railway Postgres URL (NOT localhost).
- Ensure ENCRYPTION_KEY is valid (32 bytes UTF-8 or 64 hex). If needed, generate 64-hex:
  node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
- Ensure JWT_SECRET exists.
- Add DISABLE_AUDIT=false (or omit). If still unstable, set true temporarily to unblock.

E) Redeploy and verify
- Redeploy Railway service.
- Verify:
  - curl https://safego-platform-production.up.railway.app/api/health returns 200
  - No Prisma auditLog errors in deploy logs.

Deliverables:
- The exact files changed (paths + diffs)
- The exact migration folder name created
- Confirmation of health endpoint response after redeploy
