You are an expert frontend engineer working on the SafeGo multi-app platform (Customer, Driver, Restaurant, Admin). Your current task is:

SafeGo Eats – Restaurant Dashboard
Phase 1: Navigation System (Top Nav + Left Sidebar)

GOAL (Step 1 of Restaurant Dashboard V1)
1. Implement a clean, production-ready navigation system for the SafeGo Eats Restaurant Dashboard:
   - A fixed top navigation bar.
   - A collapsible left sidebar navigation.
2. Keep ALL existing restaurant features working:
   - Home Page (Module A)
   - Orders Page (Module B)
   - Menu Management (Module C) for 500+ items
   - Orders History page
3. Do NOT break or remove existing pages, APIs, or business logic. Only extend the UI and routing.

CONTEXT
- This dashboard is for the RESTAURANT role in the SafeGo ecosystem.
- Other roles (Customer, Driver, Admin) exist in the platform but are NOT rendered in this dashboard. We only reference them where needed for naming and future navigation.
- The dashboard must be scalable and clean enough for real restaurants handling many orders.

TECH & DESIGN INSTRUCTIONS
1. Use the same frontend stack, routing library, and design system already used in the project.
2. Follow the existing typography, spacing, and button styles so the new navigation looks native, not bolted on.
3. Ensure responsive behavior:
   - Desktop: fixed sidebar + fixed top bar.
   - Tablet/mobile: sidebar collapsible or hidden behind a menu icon; top bar remains.

TOP NAVIGATION BAR – REQUIREMENTS
Create a global top nav that is visible on all restaurant pages.

A. Left section:
   - SafeGo Eats logo or text title.
   - Current restaurant name.
   - Small badge for restaurant status: [Open] or [Closed].
   - Toggle switch: “Open / Closed” that hooks into existing status logic if available, otherwise create a stub function for future wiring.

B. Center (optional but prepare layout):
   - Placeholder area for future global search (e.g., search orders/menu items). For now, show a non-functional search box component.

C. Right section:
   - Notifications icon (bell) with unread indicator count (pull from any existing notifications logic if available; if not, implement dummy state and clear interface for future integration).
   - Language selector dropdown (for now options: English, Bangla, more can be added later; switching does not need to be functional yet, just UI).
   - Profile avatar + dropdown:
       * Restaurant Profile
       * Payouts & Statements
       * Store Settings
       * Help & Support
       * Logout
   - Keep the existing logout action fully working. If there is an existing logout button, migrate its logic into the dropdown’s Logout item without breaking it.

LEFT SIDEBAR NAVIGATION – REQUIREMENTS
Create a left sidebar with clear sections and icons. It must support an “expanded” and “collapsed” mode.

A. Basic behavior:
   - Fixed to the left.
   - Scrollable if the menu is taller than the viewport.
   - Shows icons + labels when expanded.
   - Shows icons only (with tooltip on hover) when collapsed.
   - Highlight the currently active route.
   - Use a simple toggle button (e.g., “<” / “>”) to expand/collapse the sidebar.

B. Menu structure (top-level items):

1. Dashboard
   - Path: /restaurant/dashboard
   - Purpose: summary view pointing to the existing Home page (Module A).

2. Orders
   - Sub-items:
       * Live Orders – /restaurant/orders/live
       * Scheduled Orders – /restaurant/orders/scheduled
       * Order History – /restaurant/orders/history   (link existing Orders History page)
   - These should reuse existing orders components where possible.

3. Menu Management
   - Sub-items:
       * All Items – /restaurant/menu/items       (existing Module C list)
       * Categories – /restaurant/menu/categories
       * Add New Item – /restaurant/menu/new
   - Keep it optimized for 500+ items (pagination/search must remain intact).

4. Promotions (Module D, future pages)
   - Sub-items:
       * Campaigns – /restaurant/promotions/campaigns
       * Coupons & Discounts – /restaurant/promotions/coupons
       * Featured Items – /restaurant/promotions/featured
   - For now, create placeholder pages/components with simple “Coming soon” text so navigation doesn’t break.

5. Payouts & Finance (Module E)
   - Sub-items:
       * Earnings Overview – /restaurant/payouts/overview
       * Payout History – /restaurant/payouts/history
       * Bank & Tax Info – /restaurant/payouts/bank-info
   - Create simple placeholder pages. Do NOT implement business logic yet; just routing + basic layout.

6. Insights & Analytics (Module F)
   - Sub-items:
       * Sales Analytics – /restaurant/analytics/sales
       * Order Performance – /restaurant/analytics/orders
       * Menu Performance – /restaurant/analytics/menu
   - Again, create basic placeholder pages with simple text and a base layout ready for charts later.

7. Ratings & Reviews (Module G)
   - Sub-items:
       * All Reviews – /restaurant/reviews
       * Complaints / Issues – /restaurant/reviews/complaints
   - Use placeholder components for now.

8. Store Settings (Module H)
   - Sub-items:
       * Store Profile – /restaurant/settings/profile
       * Business Hours – /restaurant/settings/hours
       * Delivery & Pickup Rules – /restaurant/settings/delivery
       * Staff & Roles – /restaurant/settings/staff
       * Devices & Printers – /restaurant/settings/devices

9. Documents & Compliance
   - Sub-items:
       * Business Documents – /restaurant/documents/business
       * Health & Safety – /restaurant/documents/health
       * KYC / Verification – /restaurant/documents/kyc
   - NOTE: The KYC structure must be compatible with future country-specific flows (Bangladesh NID/passport, US EIN/SSN, etc.), but here we only build navigation and placeholder pages.

10. Support
   - Sub-items:
       * Help Center – /restaurant/support/help
       * Contact Support – /restaurant/support/contact
       * System Status – /restaurant/support/status

ROUTING & INTEGRATION
1. Wire each menu item to a distinct route using the existing routing system.
2. For pages that already exist (Home, Orders, Menu, Orders History), simply connect the new routes to the existing components.
3. For future modules (Promotions, Payouts, Analytics, Reviews, Store Settings, Documents, Support), create lightweight placeholder components with:
   - Page title
   - Short description: “This is a placeholder for [Module Name]. Do not remove; will be implemented in later phases.”
4. Ensure there is a single, central navigation config/map that defines:
   - Label
   - Icon
   - Path
   - Section/group
   - Required role (e.g., OWNER vs STAFF, even if role logic is basic for now)
   This will make it easier to apply role-based access later.

ROLE & PERMISSION PREP (Restaurant-side only)
1. Assume two restaurant-side roles for now:
   - OWNER
   - STAFF
2. Navigation visibility rules:
   - OWNER sees all items.
   - STAFF cannot see:
       * Bank & Tax Info
       * Staff & Roles
       * Documents & Compliance
   Implement this with a simple role check. If real auth is not yet implemented, create a mock role state with easy hooks for future integration.

SECURITY & STABILITY REQUIREMENTS (Phase 1)
1. Do NOT change authentication flows, tokens, or backend APIs in this phase.
2. Do NOT expose any sensitive keys or credentials on the frontend.
3. Ensure there are no navigation paths that point to non-existent components (every path should render something, even if it is a placeholder).
4. If you refactor shared layout components, keep them backwards-compatible so existing pages continue to render without errors.

DELIVERABLES
1. A working top navigation bar and left sidebar for the SafeGo Eats Restaurant Dashboard.
2. All defined routes created and wired to either:
   - Existing pages (Home, Orders, Menu, Orders History), or
   - New placeholder components for future modules.
3. Role-based visibility on navigation items for OWNER vs STAFF (even if roles are mocked).
4. Clean, well-structured code with clear comments on:
   - Where navigation config lives.
   - How to add a new menu item in future phases.
   - Where to plug in real KYC, payouts, analytics, and review logic later.

Do not move to later phases (Promotions logic, Payout calculations, Analytics charts, etc.) in this task. Only complete Phase 1 Navigation System as described above.
