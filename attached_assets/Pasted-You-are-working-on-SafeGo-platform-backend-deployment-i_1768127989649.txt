You are working on SafeGo-platform backend deployment issue.

Goal:
Fix Railway deploy crash and push the fix to GitHub.

What we see in Deploy Logs:
Prisma error: The table `public.system_job_runs` does not exist in the current database.
Then memory monitor warnings due to crash loop.

Rules:
- Do not refactor unrelated code.
- Keep changes minimal and non-breaking.
- Do not change existing APIs/routes.
- Fix must work in production (Railway) and locally.

Tasks:

1) Confirm ORM:
   - Check package.json and server code to confirm whether this project uses Prisma or Drizzle.
   - If Prisma exists, locate prisma/schema.prisma and migrations.
   - If Drizzle exists, locate drizzle config and migration files.

2) Fix missing table issue in a correct, production-safe way:
   A) If Prisma:
      - Ensure `system_job_runs` model exists in schema.prisma.
      - If model exists but table missing in prod:
        - Create/ensure migrations exist.
        - Add Railway build/start step or release step to run:
          `npx prisma migrate deploy`
      - If the model was recently added but migration not created:
        - Create migration locally:
          `npx prisma migrate dev --name add_system_job_runs`
        - Commit migration files.

   B) If Drizzle:
      - Ensure schema defines system_job_runs.
      - Ensure migrations include creation of system_job_runs table.
      - Ensure Railway deploy runs:
        `npx drizzle-kit push`
        (or the project’s configured migration command)

3) Prevent crash loop from killing the service:
   - Add a guard so that if system metrics/job runner tries to write to system_job_runs before migrations, it won’t crash the entire server.
   - The guard must be minimal:
     - Wrap the job-run insertion in try/catch and log one line error.
     - Do not spam logs in a tight loop.
   - Keep behavior otherwise unchanged.

4) Update Railway config if needed:
   - Ensure the production start process runs migrations once at boot (preferred) OR as a separate deploy step supported by the repo.
   - Do not add new services.

5) Verify:
   - Run locally:
     - `npm run check`
     - start server
     - confirm no Prisma missing-table error
   - Confirm deploy will not exceed memory due to crash loop.

6) Git:
   - Create a branch: fix/railway-migrations
   - Commit with message: "Fix production migrations for system_job_runs"
   - Push to GitHub.

Deliverables:
- List exactly which files changed and why.
- Provide the exact commands to deploy on Railway after merge.
