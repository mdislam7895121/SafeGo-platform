Good. Step 2 is correct.  
Now continue and implement the remaining onboarding steps of the full 7-step wizard.  
YOU MUST NOT simplify.

Complete the following immediately:

=====================================================
STEP 3 — ADDRESS INFO
Country-specific:

BD:
- present_address (required)
- permanent_address (required)

US:
- home_address (required)

Add validations + error states.

=====================================================
STEP 4 — GOVERNMENT ID UPLOAD
BD:
- nid_number
- nid_front_image
- nid_back_image

US:
- government_id_type
- government_id_last4
- government_id_front_image
- government_id_back_image

=====================================================
STEP 5 — DELIVERY METHOD (US ONLY)
Show only for US drivers:
- delivery_method = "car" | "bike" | "walking"

BD path: this step must be hidden entirely.

=====================================================
STEP 6 — VEHICLE DOCUMENTS
Apply conditional logic:

If US + car:
- driver_license_front
- driver_license_back
- vehicle_registration
- insurance_card

If US + bike OR US + walking:
- no vehicle document fields
- skip to next

If BD:
- driving_license_number
- driving_license_front
- driving_license_back
- vehicle_registration
- insurance_document (optional)

=====================================================
STEP 7 — FINAL REVIEW + SUBMIT
On submit:
- Lock all fields
- verification_status = "pending"
- is_verified = false
- Driver cannot access any ride/food/parcel services
- Only Admin can approve/reject

=====================================================
ADMIN PANEL — REQUIRED INTEGRATION
You must also implement:

Admin Driver Verification Module:
- view all driver fields + documents
- approve / reject
- rejection_reason field
- block / unblock driver
- update driver status
- integrate wallet negative balance logic (do NOT modify existing schema, only add where needed)

=====================================================
IMPORTANT:
Do not skip any step.  
Do not shorten the flow.  
Follow SafeGo Master Rules exactly.  
After completing, show the updated UI flow + schema + validations + API endpoints.
