URGENT: Fix Restaurant Dashboard Blank Screen — Follow SafeGo Master Rules

You must debug and fix the restaurant dashboard.  
Right now /restaurant/dashboard shows a blank white screen, which means:

1. The dashboard component is not being rendered.
2. The route definition is incorrect OR pointing to a missing component.
3. The data fetch for the restaurant profile is failing (likely undefined restaurant_id or invalid token).
4. You must check console logs, server logs, and client JS errors.

Do the following steps exactly:

-----------------------------------
A) VERIFY ROUTE CONFIGURATION
-----------------------------------
Check all existing routes. Ensure:

- The ONLY valid route for restaurant dashboard is:
  /partner/restaurant/dashboard

If any of these exist, remove or redirect them to the correct one (add only, do not delete backend routes):
  /restaurant/dashboard
  /restaurant
  /partner/restaurant
  /restaurant/home

The dashboard must live under:
  /partner/restaurant/dashboard

-----------------------------------
B) VERIFY COMPONENT FILE
-----------------------------------
Confirm that the dashboard component file actually exists.  
Examples:
- components/restaurant/RestaurantDashboard.tsx
- pages/partner/restaurant/dashboard.tsx

If missing, create the required file exactly once.  
Do NOT create duplicates.

-----------------------------------
C) FIX DATA FETCH
-----------------------------------
The dashboard must load the restaurant data by:
- reading logged-in user token
- finding linked restaurant_id
- fetching restaurant profile

If the fetch returns 500 or undefined:
- Fix the query
- Fix the restaurant lookup
- Ensure token decoding works
- Ensure restaurant is linked to the user after registration

-----------------------------------
D) ADD FALLBACK UI (SO NO BLANK SCREEN)
-----------------------------------
If data fails to load, the dashboard must:
- Show an error message
NOT render a blank white page.

-----------------------------------
E) ENFORCE SAFEGO RULES
-----------------------------------
Do NOT modify or remove:
- onboarding data models  
- admin verification fields  
- commission rules  
- negative balance rules  
- rides, deliveries, food_orders schemas  

Changes must be additive and non-breaking.

-----------------------------------
F) TEST CASES YOU MUST PERFORM
-----------------------------------
Test 1:
- Complete a new restaurant registration
- Redirect to /partner/restaurant/dashboard
- Page must load with basic info and “verification pending” banner

Test 2:
- Reload page after clearing cache
- Dashboard must still load (no blank page)

Test 3:
- Fetch should return restaurant data correctly

-----------------------------------
When finished:
- Confirm the exact route that is being used
- Confirm the dashboard now loads data
- Confirm there is no blank screen
