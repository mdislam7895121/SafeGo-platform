You have already completed and tested the Multi-Category Vehicle System and dispatch simulation. 
Now add a Driver Category Preferences layer on top of the existing logic, without changing any TLC or pricing rules.

Requirements:

1. Data model
- Extend the Driver (or Vehicle) model to store `allowedCategories: string[]`.
- `allowedCategories` must always be a subset of `eligibleCategories`.
- On initial vehicle approval, set `allowedCategories = eligibleCategories` by default.

2. Driver app UI
- In the driver app, add a "Ride Preferences" section under the profile/settings screen.
- For each item in `eligibleCategories`, show a toggle switch (SAFEGO_X, SAFEGO_COMFORT, COMFORT_XL, SAFEGO_XL, SAFEGO_BLACK, SAFEGO_BLACK_SUV, SAFEGO_WAV).
- For WAV drivers:
  - The SAFEGO_WAV toggle must be locked ON (cannot be disabled) with an info tooltip about accessibility requirements.
- Do not allow a state where `allowedCategories` becomes empty. If the last category would be turned off, show a small error and keep it ON.

3. Admin panel
- On the driver detail page, show:
  - `eligibleCategories` (read-only, from vehicle verification)
  - `allowedCategories` (read-only, chosen by the driver)
- Add an admin button "Reset ride preferences" that sets 
  `allowedCategories = eligibleCategories` and writes an audit log entry (who reset, when).

4. Dispatch engine changes
- When matching a trip with category C:
  - Filter candidate drivers by:
    - driver is online and available,
    - driver is within the search radius,
    - C is in `eligibleCategories`,
    - C is in `allowedCategories`.
- Keep the existing hierarchy and rules (BLACK, BLACK_SUV, XL, WAV, etc.) exactly as they are.
- Do NOT modify any TLC fee logic, fare engine, or commission logic. This feature only affects which drivers are considered for a request.

5. Tests
- Add tests for:
  - Cadillac example: a vehicle eligible for [SAFEGO_X, SAFEGO_COMFORT, SAFEGO_BLACK, SAFEGO_BLACK_SUV] but with `allowedCategories = [SAFEGO_BLACK, SAFEGO_BLACK_SUV]`. Verify that SAFEGO_X and SAFEGO_COMFORT trips never dispatch to this driver.
  - An X-only vehicle cannot opt into BLACK or other premium categories.
  - A WAV driver cannot disable SAFEGO_WAV, and WAV trips still dispatch correctly.
  - A scenario that combines AI suggestions, admin approval, and driver preferences to ensure all three layers work together.

6. Documentation
- Update replit.md with a "Driver Category Preferences" section explaining:
  - the difference between eligibility and preferences,
  - default behavior,
  - WAV exception,
  - how this interacts with the AI Marketplace Balancer and does not change TLC or fare logic.

Keep all existing tests green and do not introduce experimental features beyond this preferences layer.
