Task: Fix desktop home layout so it always shows the 3-column “Plan your ride | Choose your ride | Map” screen, while keeping the current multi-step flow on mobile exactly as is.

Follow all SafeGo rules:
- Do not change any backend logic (pricing, promos, commission, dispatch, routing, KYC, payments).
- Only change the customer web UI layout and responsive behavior.
- Re-use existing components – do not fork duplicates of address bars, ride cards, or map logic.

1. Current behavior (what we have now)
- Route `/customer` shows the “Good night, islam789 – Where are you going?” home screen with:
  - Pickup capsule
  - Dropoff capsule
  - Time selector (Now / For me)
  - Payment method
  - “See prices” button
- Route `/customer/ride` (or `/customer/ride-request`, confirm in code) shows the 3-column layout:
  - Left: Plan your ride card with pickup/dropoff.
  - Middle: “Choose your ride” list with SafeGo X / SafeGo Comfort / Comfort XL / XL / Black / Black SUV / WAV.
  - Right: Map with route A→B and zoom.

We want:
- Desktop (laptop / large screen) to land directly on the 3-column layout as the “home” experience.
- Mobile to keep the current 3-step wizard (home → choose ride → choose route).

2. New responsive behavior specification

2.1. Breakpoint
- Use a single breakpoint, for example:
  - Desktop: `min-width: 1024px` (or use our existing lg breakpoint if we have Tailwind or similar).
  - Mobile / tablet: below that.

2.2. Desktop behavior (>= 1024px)
- When the user visits `/customer`:
  - Immediately render the 3-column “Plan your ride” experience – the same layout we currently see on `/customer/ride`.
  - Do NOT show the “Good night, islam789 / See prices” greeting screen at all on desktop.
- Layout details:
  - Left column: Plan your ride card with the new capsule address bars (pickup + dropoff) that we already implemented.
  - Middle column: “Choose your ride” list with the new SafeGo ride cards and 3D car images.
  - Right column: Map with the active route, zoomed between pickup A and dropoff B.
  - Keep SafeGo Everyday Saver banner and payment info where they already exist in the 3-column screen.
- Routing:
  - Option A (preferred and simplest): On `/customer` detect desktop via a `useIsDesktop` hook or window width, and for desktop simply render the same component that is used by `/customer/ride` (or redirect internally to that component).
  - Option B: Make the main “RideExperience” component accept a `mode` prop (`"desktop"` or `"mobile"`) and reuse the same logic, but for desktop always show the 3-column view.
- Address state:
  - The pickup/dropoff state should be shared with mobile home so that if the user typed addresses on mobile home and then switches orientation, the same values appear on the 3-column layout.
  - Use a single source of truth (context, global store, or a shared hook) instead of duplicating local state in two components.

2.3. Mobile behavior (< 1024px)
- Keep the current behavior exactly:
  1) `/customer` shows greeting: “Good night, islam789 – Where are you going?”
     - Two capsule address fields:
       - Pickup (with current location dot / edit icon).
       - “Where to?” dropoff.
     - Time selector (Now / For me).
     - Payment row.
     - “See prices” button.
  2) After tapping “See prices”, user goes to the ride list screen:
     - Only ONE address section visible at top (the new two-line capsule we implemented).
     - Below that, vertical list of SafeGo rides.
  3) After tapping “Choose your route”, user goes to the route selection screen:
     - Map takes main area.
     - The 3 route buttons (Fastest, route 2, route 3) are fully visible above the “Request ride” button (no cropping on the right side).
- Important: The desktop changes must not break this mobile flow.

3. Remove duplicated address bars on desktop
- On desktop, there must NOT be three separate screens with address bars:
  - No greeting screen with pickup/dropoff on `/customer`.
  - Only the 3-column layout should show the address capsule in the left “Plan your ride” panel.
- Implementation:
  - For desktop, when on `/customer`, skip rendering the greeting UI component entirely.
  - Instead directly render the 3-column Ride page component, wiring it to the same address state.
  - Ensure that the Plan card on the left uses the capsule style we defined previously (not big card blocks).

4. Fix the “Choose your route” buttons on mobile
- On the mobile route selection screen:
  - Make sure the 3 buttons (Fastest, route 2, route 3) fit fully inside the viewport width with proper spacing.
  - Use flex with `justify-between` or equal width buttons so that the third button is not cut off on the right.
  - Keep “Request ride” button sticky at the bottom with full width.

5. Map behavior after “See prices”
- When user hits “See prices” on mobile:
  - The intermediate “Plan card over map” floating view should only be visible briefly while we compute routes OR you can fade it out and show the map in the background.
  - After routes and prices are ready, the user is on the ride list screen; the full-screen map is not needed at this step.
- When user taps “Choose your route”:
  - Transition to the route screen.
  - Map must:
    - Center and zoom so the user’s pickup and dropoff are both visible.
    - Show the current location marker (A) clearly.
    - Highlight the selected route.

6. Code hygiene and safety
- Do not touch:
  - Fare calculation logic, promo engine, commission split, driver earnings.
  - Driver / rider visibility rules we implemented earlier.
  - Backend APIs or environment config.
- Limit changes to:
  - UI layout components in the customer web app.
  - Routing configuration for `/customer` and `/customer/ride`.
  - Responsive CSS / breakpoint conditions.

7. Final checks
- Test matrix:
  - Desktop browser at full width:
    - Visit `/customer` → should immediately show the 3-column “Plan your ride | Choose your ride | Map” layout.
  - Mobile preview (iPhone 15 / Pixel 8):
    - Step 1: greeting + address + “See prices”.
    - Step 2: ride list with our new SafeGo ride cards.
    - Step 3: route selection with 3 fully visible buttons and a clear map.
  - Confirm there is no screen where address bars appear three times in a row.

Please implement this behavior now, reusing existing components, and then summarize exactly what you changed (files + main components) so we can keep tracking.
