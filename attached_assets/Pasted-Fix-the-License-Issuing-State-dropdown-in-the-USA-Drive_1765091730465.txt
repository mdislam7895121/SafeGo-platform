Fix the "License Issuing State" dropdown in the USA Driver License step.

Context:
- Route: /partner/driver/register
- Step: Driver License (USA drivers)
- Issue: The dropdown opens and shows all US states, but after selecting a state the field clears and no value remains selected.

You MUST keep all existing SafeGo global rules intact:
- 4 roles: customer, driver, restaurant, admin (no mixing).
- 3 services: ride-hailing, food delivery, parcel delivery.
- Country KYC rules for BD and US must remain unchanged.
- No changes to rides, food_orders, deliveries schemas, commission logic, or admin permissions.
This task is ONLY about the Driver License state field UI + form binding.

Bug symptoms:
- The user can open the "License Issuing State" select.
- States are visible.
- When a state is tapped/clicked, the dropdown closes but no state appears as selected.
- Submitting the form likely sends an empty license_state.

Required fix:

1) Controlled value must be bound correctly
   - Ensure the select component's `value` is bound to a single source of truth, e.g.:
       value = form.license_state
   - Do NOT bind to a different field like `form.state` or `address.state`.

2) onChange handler must update the same field
   - When the user selects an option, it must call:
       setForm(prev => ({ ...prev, license_state: selectedValue }))
     or the equivalent in your form library (React Hook Form, Formik, etc.).
   - Make sure there is no mismatch between the option `value` and what you save.

3) Option values vs labels
   - Check that each option's `value` matches what is stored:
       Example:
         value="NY", label="New York"
         value="NJ", label="New Jersey"
   - Do not use full labels as value if your form expects abbreviations.

4) Initial value
   - Initial value should be either:
       "" (empty) or the driver's previously saved license_state.
   - Do NOT reset the select to "" on every render or validation error.

5) No auto-overwrite
   - Make sure no effect or validation logic overwrites `license_state` immediately after change.
   - Remove any code that forces `license_state` to follow the home address state.

6) Testing
   - In mobile preview:
       - Open the dropdown, select "New York".
       - The field must show "New York" (or "NY") as selected and keep that state.
   - Submit the form and check that the backend receives a non-empty license_state.

Non-breaking:
- Do not change any other KYC fields.
- Do not touch Bangladesh flows.
- Do not rename any existing fields in the database.
- Only fix the binding of the "License Issuing State" select so it persists the selected value.
