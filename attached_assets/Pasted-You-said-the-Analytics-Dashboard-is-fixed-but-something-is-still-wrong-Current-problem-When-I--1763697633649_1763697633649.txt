You said the Analytics Dashboard is fixed, but something is still wrong.

Current problem:
- When I open the Analytics Dashboard at route /admin/analytics in Preview, the page is completely blank white.
- No header, no filters, no error banner, nothing – just a white screen.
- This happens even after your last fix where you adjusted date ranges, query construction, and RBAC guard.
- Previously I was seeing red error banners (string pattern error, failed to load analytics). Now those are gone but the whole page is empty.

Please do a focused Step 49 fix for the Analytics Dashboard with all our SafeGo rules:

1. Reproduce the issue
   - Run the dev server and open /admin/analytics in the browser (both desktop and mobile viewport).
   - Confirm that the page is blank and note any errors in the browser console and network tab.

2. Debug the frontend component
   - Open the React/TypeScript file for the analytics page (likely client/src/pages/admin/analytics.tsx or similar).
   - Look for any early `return null`, uncaught exception, or invalid JSX that could cause a blank screen.
   - Verify that the component still renders the Analytics header, filters (date range + country), and tab sections (Drivers, Customers, Restaurants, Revenue, Risk).
   - Make sure any new guard or conditional you added for RBAC or date ranges does NOT stop the component from rendering when data is missing.

3. Fix the analytics query and rendering logic
   - Ensure date range parameters are constructed in the correct format expected by the backend.
   - If the backend returns an error, the page must still render with a clear error banner (like before), not a white screen.
   - Add defensive checks around all data access (e.g., avoid accessing properties of `undefined`).
   - Make sure all tabs handle “no data” states gracefully with friendly messages instead of crashing.

4. RBAC and security rules
   - Keep the RBAC guard for the analytics page aligned with our SafeGo security rules (no weakening of permissions).
   - Do NOT change or remove roles, capabilities, or JWT handling that were already validated in earlier steps.
   - Confirm that an admin with the demo credentials (admin@demo.com / demo123, SUPER_ADMIN) can see the analytics page.

5. Regression safety
   - Do not change any other admin dashboard cards, payout pages, capabilities endpoint, or financial suite logic.
   - No breaking changes to existing security phases, payouts, wallets, or support chat.
   - Keep all previous SafeGo security phases and admin dashboard behavior intact.

6. Verification checklist
   - /admin/analytics loads with:
     - Page title and description
     - Date range selector and country selector
     - All tabs visible: Drivers, Customers, Restaurants, Revenue, Risk
   - When data loads correctly, charts/tables show analytics.
   - When the backend returns an error or there is no data, the page still renders with a visible error or “no data” message — NOT a blank white screen.
   - Works in both desktop and mobile viewport (no layout that hides everything off-screen).

7. Documentation
   - Update replit.md under Step 49 to clearly describe:
     - Root cause of the blank page
     - Files changed
     - How the new error handling and RBAC checks work
     - How to test /admin/analytics safely

When you are done, summarize exactly what caused the blank page and list the files you modified, then ask me to test /admin/analytics again.
