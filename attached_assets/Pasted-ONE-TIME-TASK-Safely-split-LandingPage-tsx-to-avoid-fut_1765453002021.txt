ONE-TIME TASK: Safely split LandingPage.tsx to avoid future memory issues.

Goal:
Reduce bundle/memory pressure for the public landing page WITHOUT changing any UI, layout, copy, routing, or architecture.

Hard Scope Limits:
- You are ONLY allowed to touch:
  - client/src/routes/LandingPage.tsx  (or wherever the main landing page component lives)
  - New presentational components under: client/src/components/landing/*
- You are NOT allowed to modify:
  - App.tsx routing
  - Any auth logic
  - Any backend code or APIs
  - Any other pages (ride, food, parcel, shop, ticket, admin, driver, restaurant, etc.)

Refactor Plan (do exactly this):

1) Create new presentational components:
   - client/src/components/landing/LandingHero.tsx
   - client/src/components/landing/LandingCountryTabs.tsx
   - client/src/components/landing/LandingServices.tsx
   - client/src/components/landing/LandingFooter.tsx
   (If needed, you may add 1–2 more components, but only for the landing page.)

2) Move EXISTING JSX from LandingPage.tsx into these components:
   - Hero section (title “Move, eat, and deliver with SafeGo”, buttons, etc.) → LandingHero
   - Country tabs (Bangladesh / United States / Global) → LandingCountryTabs
   - Services list (Rides, Food Delivery, Parcel Delivery, Local Shops, Tickets & Travel) → LandingServices
   - Bottom/footer area → LandingFooter

3) Update LandingPage.tsx to look like:

   - Import the new components.
   - Render them in the SAME order as before:
     <LandingHero />
     <LandingCountryTabs />
     <LandingServices />
     <LandingFooter />

4) STRICT VISUAL RULES:
   - Do NOT change any text.
   - Do NOT change any spacing, colors, fonts, or layout.
   - Do NOT add or remove any buttons, cards, or sections.
   - The final UI at "/" must look pixel-identical to the current landing page.

5) Routing rules:
   - Keep "/" mapped to LandingPage as it is now.
   - Do NOT add or remove any routes.
   - Do NOT introduce any new wrappers (AuthenticatedApp, etc.).
   - Do NOT add lazy-loading or Suspense here. Only split into smaller files.

6) After refactor, verify:
   - "/" loads correctly with the exact same design.
   - Ride / Food / Parcel / Shop / Ticket / Admin pages still load.
   - No “Unexpected end of input” or bundle errors appear.
   - Memory usage is reduced compared to before (you can mention the new approximate usage).

7) Final report:
   - List the exact files you created/modified.
   - Confirm that this change is NON-BREAKING:
     - No backend or collections changed.
     - No SafeGo roles, KYC, commission, or status flows changed.
     - Only landing page presentation code was split into smaller components.
