Follow all SafeGo Master Rules and implement D12: Driver Vehicle Center (Web Version).

GOAL:
Create a complete Uber-style Vehicle Information Center under /driver/vehicle. Drivers must be able to add, update, and view their vehicle information and upload vehicle photos. This page must integrate with D10 onboarding checklist and match the existing SafeGo design.

1) ROUTE
Create:
- /driver/vehicle
- Add navigation from D10 “Vehicle Information” checklist item
- Optional sidebar item: “Vehicle”

2) PAGE HEADER
Add:
- Title: “Vehicle Information”
- Subtitle: “Add and manage your vehicle details to start driving with SafeGo.”

3) VEHICLE INFO FIELDS (Editable UI)
Create editable cards for:
- Vehicle Make
- Vehicle Model
- Vehicle Year
- Color
- License Plate Number
- VIN (store full but show masked: *****4321)
Each card must include:
- Edit button

4) VEHICLE PHOTOS (Upload Required)
Create upload cards for:

5) EXPIRY FIELDS
Add fields with date selectors:

7) CHECKLIST INTEGRATION (D10)
If all required vehicle fields + photos are completed:
- Mark “Vehicle Information” item in /driver/getting-started as Completed
- Recalculate progress

8) UI STYLE
- Uber-style clean cards
- Consistent spacing, fonts, icons
- Works on mobile
- Clear badges: Approved / Pending / Missing

9) SECURITY RULES
- Mask VIN except last 4 digits
- Do not log VIN or plate number
- Safe image handling
- Only authenticated drivers can access

10) FINALIZE
Build the entire page, link all buttons, validate mobile layout, ensure expiry warnings work, and integrate with D10 progress system.
