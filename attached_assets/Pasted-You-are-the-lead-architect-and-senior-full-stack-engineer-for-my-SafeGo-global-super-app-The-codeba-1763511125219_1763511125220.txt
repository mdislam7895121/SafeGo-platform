You are the lead architect and senior full-stack engineer for my SafeGo global super-app. The codebase is already production-ready. Do NOT rewrite existing logic or break any working flows. Make only minimal, incremental changes.

Context:
- Stack: Node.js + Express, Prisma + PostgreSQL (Neon), React + TypeScript + Vite, TanStack Query, shadcn/ui.
- Roles: customer, driver, restaurant, admin.
- Status:
  - Auth, KYC, ride matching, driver management, admin dashboard overview are working.
  - Driver Management page is complete.
  - Restaurant side is basic/incomplete. There will NOT be a huge number of restaurants, so we just need a simple but reliable admin UI.

Goal:
Implement a simple Restaurant Management area for the admin, reusing the driver management patterns but without over-engineering (no complex pagination or heavy filtering). Keep it safe and non-breaking.

Requirements:

1) Admin Restaurant List (simple table)
- Add an admin page, e.g. `/admin/restaurants`, protected by the existing admin ProtectedRoute.
- The “Restaurants” card on the admin dashboard should navigate to this page on click.
- On this page, show a simple table of all restaurants:
  - email
  - country
  - KYC status (pending / verified / rejected)
  - account status (active / suspended / blocked)
  - current wallet balance (if available)
- Since the number of restaurants is small, you can:
  - load all restaurants in one request (no pagination required),
  - add a basic search by email (optional),
  - add simple filter buttons for status (All / Active / Suspended / Blocked) if it is easy to reuse from the driver list.

2) Restaurant Details & Basic Actions
- Each row can have a “View” or “Manage” button opening a details view (page or drawer).
- In details view, show:
  - restaurant profile info (email, country, address/name if present),
  - KYC info + status,
  - wallet info (balance / owed amounts) if modeled,
  - basic stats like total completed orders if this data already exists.
- Add two admin actions:
  - Suspend / Unsuspend restaurant
  - Block / Unblock restaurant
- Reuse the same backend patterns used for driver suspend/block:
  - dedicated PATCH endpoints,
  - updates to Prisma models on RestaurantProfile (or equivalent),
  - return updated restaurant object so the UI stays in sync.

3) Pending Restaurant KYC (simple integration)
- On the KYC Approvals page, ensure restaurant KYC entries are visible:
  - Either via a small tab or a filter (e.g. “Drivers / Customers / Restaurants”).
- The admin dashboard “Pending KYC” tile should include restaurant KYC count in the total.
- When admin approves a restaurant KYC:
  - restaurant status becomes “verified”,
  - restaurant appears as verified in the restaurant list,
  - dashboard auto-refresh (existing 5-second refresh) shows updated numbers.

4) Complaints (minimal support)
- If a complaint model already exists for drivers, extend it minimally to support restaurants as well (for example, a `type` field: driver/restaurant + a restaurantId).
- For now, it is enough that:
  - restaurant-related complaints are counted in the “Open Complaints” metric on the admin dashboard,
  - the existing admin complaints page can show which complaints are for restaurants (one extra column).

5) Dashboard Integration
- Keep the dashboard simple:
  - “Restaurants” count = total number of restaurant profiles.
  - “Pending KYC” = all pending KYC across drivers, customers, restaurants.
  - “Open Complaints” = driver + restaurant complaints.
- All tiles must be clickable and navigate to:
  - Restaurants → `/admin/restaurants`
  - Pending KYC → `/admin/kyc`
  - Open Complaints → `/admin/complaints`

6) Security Phase – RBAC and Safety
- Apply strict admin-only access for all new routes and endpoints:
  - Use existing auth middleware to ensure only admin can:
    - view restaurant list,
    - see restaurant details,
    - call suspend/block endpoints.
- Validate IDs and payloads on all new PATCH/GET endpoints.
- Do NOT leak sensitive KYC data to non-admin roles.
- Keep error messages generic on the client; no stack traces.

7) Non-breaking changes
- Do NOT modify or break:
  - customer flows,
  - driver flows,
  - existing driver management.
- Reuse existing helper functions, components, and hooks where possible.
- If a shared component must be changed, do it in a backward-compatible way and document the change in comments.

8) Testing
- After implementation, run and summarize end-to-end tests:
  - restaurant signup + KYC submission + admin approval,
  - admin viewing restaurant list and details,
  - admin suspending and re-activating a restaurant,
  - dashboard tiles navigating correctly and updating numbers,
  - no regression in driver/customer/admin flows.

Finally, provide a summary:
- files changed (backend + frontend),
- new API endpoints,
- how an admin can use the Restaurant Management page in normal operation.
