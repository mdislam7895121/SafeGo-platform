SYSTEM ROLE:
You are a senior frontend engineer working on the SafeGo Global web app.
Assume all legal policy CONTENT is already written and approved.
Your task is ONLY to fix routing and page availability.
Do NOT rewrite policy text.

TASK TITLE
==================================================
FIX LEGAL PAGE ROUTING (404 ISSUE) – SAFEGO WEB APP

==================================================
PROBLEM STATEMENT
==================================================

On the SafeGo website footer, the following legal links exist:

- /terms
- /privacy
- /cookie-policy
- /safety-policy
- /data-deletion
- /partner-terms

However, visiting these routes currently returns:
"404 Page Not Found – Did you forget to add the page to the router?"

This is a ROUTING / PAGE REGISTRATION issue, not a policy content issue.

==================================================
OBJECTIVE
==================================================

Ensure that ALL legal footer links resolve successfully (no 404),
using a PILOT-SAFE, MINIMAL implementation.

==================================================
REQUIREMENTS (STRICT)
==================================================

1) Create two primary legal pages:
   - /terms
   - /privacy

2) Paste the already-approved policy content into:
   - Terms of Service → /terms
   - Privacy Policy → /privacy

3) For the following routes:
   - /cookie-policy
   - /safety-policy
   - /data-deletion
   - /partner-terms

   DO NOT create separate pages yet.

   Instead, implement TEMPORARY redirects:
   - Routes related to privacy → redirect to /privacy
   - Routes related to terms/safety/partners → redirect to /terms

4) No footer links should return 404.

==================================================
TECHNICAL NOTES
==================================================

- Use the existing routing system (Next.js / React Router / Expo Router / Vite Router – whichever is in use).
- Redirects can be implemented via:
  - Router redirects
  - Middleware
  - Fallback routes
- Do NOT change URLs shown in the footer.
- Do NOT remove any footer links.

==================================================
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
==================================================

- Visiting /terms loads Terms content
- Visiting /privacy loads Privacy content
- Visiting any other legal footer link redirects cleanly
- No 404 errors on legal pages
- No UI/UX redesign
- No policy text changes

==================================================
OUT OF SCOPE
==================================================

- Creating separate cookie/safety pages
- SEO optimization
- Styling changes
- Content rewriting

==================================================
DELIVERABLE
==================================================

- Working legal routes
- Confirmation of which routes redirect where
- No regressions elsewhere in the app
