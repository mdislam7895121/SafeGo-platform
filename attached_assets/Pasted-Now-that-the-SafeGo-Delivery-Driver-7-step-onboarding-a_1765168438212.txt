Now that the SafeGo Delivery Driver 7-step onboarding and country-specific KYC system is fully completed, proceed to the next mandatory SafeGo phase.

Implement the Driver Dashboard + Go-Online Engine according to the SafeGo Master Rules.

=====================================================
A) DRIVER DASHBOARD REQUIREMENTS

When a driver logs in, show:

1. verification_status badge  
   - pending → block everything except profile  
   - approved → allow Go-Online  
   - rejected → block and show rejection_reason  

2. Earnings Summary  
   - today's earnings  
   - weekly earnings  
   - negative balance (commission owed)

3. Online/Offline Toggle  
   - disabled until is_verified = true  
   - when turned ON → start real-time location updates  

4. Navigation Cards  
   - Ride Tasks  
   - Food Delivery Tasks  
   - Parcel Delivery Tasks  
   (show counters for pending/active tasks)

5. Notification Center  
   - verification approval/rejection  
   - new tasks  
   - payout updates  

=====================================================
B) DRIVER GO-ONLINE ENGINE

Implement the following:

- Driver cannot go online if verification_status != "approved"  
- When going online → update driver_status = "available"  
- Start location engine  
- Register driver in matching pool for all 3 services:
  ride-hailing, food delivery, parcel delivery  

- When offline → driver_status = "offline"  
- Stop location engine  

=====================================================
C) BACKEND REQUIREMENTS

Add/update API routes (ADD ONLY — do not modify or remove existing):

- GET /driver/dashboard  
- POST /driver/go-online  
- POST /driver/go-offline  
- POST /driver/update-location  

=====================================================
