Refine the SafeGo Eats Restaurant Dashboard HEADER again. The current header looks cluttered and overloaded in a single row (brand, restaurant name, ID, badges, toggles, search bar all together). I want a cleaner, simpler, more professional layout with clear visual grouping.

GOAL:
- Clean, minimal, well-organized header
- Desktop, tablet, and mobile friendly
- No backend, routing, RBAC, or KYC changes
- Restaurant portal only; do not affect customer, driver, or admin portals

NEW HEADER LAYOUT (DESKTOP)

Use a 3-row structure:

ROW 1 (TOP BAR):
- LEFT: "SafeGo Eats" brand logo/title only
- RIGHT: notification icon with badge + profile avatar/menu (MO)
- Keep this row slim and simple

ROW 2 (RESTAURANT IDENTITY + STATUS):
- LEFT SIDE:
    • Restaurant name (e.g. "mohammad") in bold
    • Next to it: small "Verified" badge
    • BELOW (small text, muted): "ID: 8cf32da7-d108-41b3-8fb4-051c7e694fa4" and location text
- RIGHT SIDE:
    • One combined status pill, e.g. "Accepting orders" (ON/OFF)
    • Next to it: small "Active" pill
    • Make both pills compact, same height, same style

Important: DO NOT repeat "Verified & Active" again in a separate big blue chip under the header. Keep verification and active status only in row 2, small and neat.

ROW 3 (SEARCH):
- One full-width search bar: "Search orders, menu items, customers…"
- Centered horizontally with proper margins
- On mobile, this can be directly under row 1

MOBILE/TABLET BEHAVIOR:

Mobile:
- Row 1: SafeGo Eats (left) + notifications + avatar (right)
- Row 2: Restaurant name + verified badge + small status text
- Row 3: full-width search bar
- Row 4 (if needed): small "Accepting orders" toggle + "Active" pill stacked, not in the same long row

Tablet:
- Top bar same as mobile
- Row 2: Restaurant name + badges left, status pills right
- Row 3: full-width search

CLEANUP:
- Remove any duplicate badges (no “Verified & Active” pill floating alone in the content area)
- Align everything to a clear grid (use flexbox with justify-between and consistent gaps)
- Ensure there is enough whitespace between groups so the header does NOT look crowded
- Keep fonts and sizes consistent with the design system

TEST:
- Verify header layout on:
    • Desktop viewport
    • Tablet viewport
    • Mobile viewport
- Confirm:
    • No overlapping text
    • No wrapped long ID in the middle of the header
    • Search bar is always clearly visible and usable

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT touch any backend logic, APIs, routes, or database schema.
- Do NOT modify customer, driver, or admin portals.
- Keep all KYC and RBAC checks unchanged for all 4 roles.
- Do not change rides, food_orders, or deliveries flows.

After updating, show me screenshots or a description of the new header layout on desktop and mobile, and confirm that the old “cluttered” row has been simplified into the 3-row structure described above.
