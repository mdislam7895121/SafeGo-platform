You are working on the SafeGo global platform.
This task is about ADDING vehicle types for USA, inspired by Uber capabilities
but using SafeGo’s own naming, branding, and country-based rules.

You must follow all existing SafeGo rules. Do NOT remove or rename any existing
fields, APIs, routes, or logic. Only ADD new configurations where needed.

--------------------------------
SCOPE
--------------------------------
Country: United States (US)
Service types affected:
- Ride-hailing
- Food delivery
- Parcel delivery

--------------------------------
VEHICLE TYPES TO ADD (USA)
--------------------------------

Passenger Ride Vehicles (US):
1. SafeGo Standard
2. SafeGo Comfort
3. SafeGo Eco (Hybrid / Electric)
4. SafeGo Family (6–7 seater)
5. SafeGo Executive
6. SafeGo Executive SUV
7. SafeGo Schedule (Advance booking)
8. SafeGo Hourly (Time-based)
9. SafeGo City Taxi (city-regulated)

Delivery / Parcel Vehicles (US):
10. SafeGo Car Delivery
11. SafeGo Van Delivery
12. SafeGo Connect (same-day parcel)

--------------------------------
IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------

1. GLOBAL VEHICLE MASTER
- Ensure all vehicle types exist in a global vehicle master list/table/config.
- Each vehicle must have:
  - vehicle_key (stable internal id)
  - display_name
  - country = "US"
  - service_type (ride | food | parcel)
  - capacity (passengers or parcel size)
  - is_premium (true/false)
  - is_time_based (true/false)
  - is_enabled (true/false)

2. COUNTRY-BASED VISIBILITY
- Vehicles must only appear when country = US.
- Do NOT show Bike, Scooter, or Bicycle vehicles in US.

3. PRICING RULE
- If pricing is NOT configured for a vehicle:
  - It must NOT appear in customer apps.
- Pricing logic must remain backend-driven.

4. DRIVER ELIGIBILITY
- Executive / Executive SUV:
  - Require stricter driver eligibility flags (no document details exposed).
- City Taxi:
  - Must respect city/state-specific enable rules.

5. UI SAFETY
- Never render a blank page.
- If no vehicles are available, show a clear empty-state message:
  “No vehicles available in your area right now.”

6. SECURITY & PERMISSIONS
- Customers cannot see driver documents.
- Drivers cannot see customer sensitive data.
- Only Admin can enable/disable vehicle types or pricing.

7. NON-BREAKING CHANGE RULE
- Do NOT modify existing routes, collections, or APIs.
- Only ADD new vehicle entries/configurations.
- All changes must be backward-compatible.

--------------------------------
VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
--------------------------------

After implementation, confirm:
1. USA customers see only the USA vehicle list above.
2. No Uber naming appears anywhere in UI or code.
3. Vehicles without pricing do not appear.
4. App loads with no white screens.
5. Admin can toggle vehicles on/off safely.

--------------------------------
DELIVERABLE
--------------------------------
Provide a short report including:
- Where vehicle definitions were added (files/modules)
- How country filtering is enforced
- Proof that USA UI shows the correct list

Proceed carefully and complete this end-to-end.
