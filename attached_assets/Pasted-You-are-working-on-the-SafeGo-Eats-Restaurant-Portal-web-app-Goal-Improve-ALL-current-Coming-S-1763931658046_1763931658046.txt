You are working on the SafeGo Eats Restaurant Portal (web app).

Goal: Improve ALL current “Coming Soon” placeholder pages for restaurants, WITHOUT breaking any routes, back-end logic, or future implementation plans.

Scope – Restaurant portal placeholder pages:
- Orders → Scheduled Orders: /restaurant/orders/scheduled
- Promotions → Featured Items: /restaurant/promotions/featured
- Ratings & Reviews → Complaints / Issues: /restaurant/reviews/complaints
- Store Settings → Store Profile: /restaurant/settings/profile
- Store Settings → Staff & Roles: /restaurant/settings/staff
- Store Settings → Devices & Printers: /restaurant/settings/devices
- Documents & Compliance → Business Documents: /restaurant/documents/business
- Documents & Compliance → Health & Safety: /restaurant/documents/health
- Documents & Compliance → KYC / Verification: /restaurant/documents/kyc
- Support → Help Center: /restaurant/support/help
- Plus any other restaurant routes that currently show the generic “Coming Soon” block with a small info icon and paragraph.

High-level requirements:
1. DO NOT remove or change any route, layout shell, or navigation entry. These are reserved for future phases.
2. Keep these pages as placeholders (no real business logic, no forms, no API calls), but make the UI professional and consistent.
3. Respect existing SafeGo global rules:
   - KYC & RBAC security model
   - No exposure of sensitive data
   - No fake functionality that could confuse real users
4. The implementation must be fully additive and non-breaking.

Design: unified “Feature Coming Soon” layout
Create a reusable component, for example:
- `FeaturePlaceholderLayout` (or similar name) under a shared components folder already used in the restaurant client.
Responsibilities:
- Take props like:
  - `title`
  - `subtitle`
  - `icon` (optional, using existing icon set if available)
  - `plannedCapabilities` (string list)
  - `statusTag` (e.g. "Planned", "In design", "Future release")
  - `infoNote` (small muted text)
- Render a clean, centered layout with:
  - Main title (page feature name)
  - Short subtitle (1–2 sentences, no more)
  - A status pill (e.g. “Planned – Not yet available”) in a subtle style
  - Optional icon in a circle/soft card
  - A bulleted list “What you’ll be able to do here” using `plannedCapabilities`
  - A secondary note explaining that the feature will be enabled in a later phase and navigation is already wired
  - A small “Back to Dashboard” button/link using the existing button styles and routing helpers

Apply the unified placeholder to each target page:
For every page listed in the Scope, replace the current raw “This is a placeholder / Coming Soon” block with the new `FeaturePlaceholderLayout`, using appropriate copy. Example guidelines:

1) Scheduled Orders
- title: "Scheduled Orders"
- subtitle: "Manage orders that customers schedule for future delivery or pickup."
- plannedCapabilities:
  - "View upcoming scheduled orders and time windows"
  - "Modify preparation and pickup times"
  - "Pause or resume accepting scheduled orders"
- statusTag: "Planned feature"
- infoNote: Mention that scheduled order routing is already configured for a future release.

2) Featured Items
- title: "Featured Items"
- subtitle: "Highlight special menu items to increase visibility and sales."
- plannedCapabilities:
  - "Pin signature dishes to the top of your menu"
  - "Run time-limited spotlights on items"
  - "Track performance of featured items"
- statusTag: "In planning"
- infoNote: Similar small note about future rollout.

3) Complaints / Issues
- title: "Complaints & Issues"
- subtitle: "Central place to review and respond to customer complaints."
- plannedCapabilities:
  - "View complaints linked to specific orders"
  - "Respond with suggested resolutions"
  - "Escalate issues to SafeGo support when needed"
- statusTag: "Future release"

4) Store Profile
- title: "Store Profile"
- subtitle: "Manage your restaurant identity, branding, and public details."
- plannedCapabilities:
  - "Update restaurant name, description, and categories"
  - "Configure branding elements and photos"
  - "Control what customers see in the SafeGo Eats app"

5) Staff & Roles
- title: "Staff & Roles"
- subtitle: "Manage staff accounts and permissions for your restaurant."
- plannedCapabilities:
  - "Invite staff and assign roles"
  - "Control who can manage orders, menus, and payouts"
  - "Audit key staff actions for security"

6) Devices & Printers
- title: "Devices & Printers"
- subtitle: "Connect tablets and receipt printers used in your restaurant."
- plannedCapabilities:
  - "Register front-of-house and kitchen devices"
  - "Configure receipt printer settings"
  - "Monitor online/offline device status"

7) Business Documents
- title: "Business Documents"
- subtitle: "Upload and manage your business licenses and permits."
- plannedCapabilities:
  - "Store scanned licenses and certificates"
  - "Track expiry dates and compliance reminders"
  - "Share documents securely with SafeGo support"

8) Health & Safety
- title: "Health & Safety"
- subtitle: "Manage health certificates and safety compliance."
- plannedCapabilities:
  - "Upload health inspection documents"
  - "Track safety certifications and expiry"
  - "Provide proof of compliance to delivery partners"

9) KYC / Verification
- title: "KYC / Verification"
- subtitle: "Complete identity and business verification for your restaurant."
- plannedCapabilities:
  - "Submit country-specific documents (Bangladesh NID/passport, US EIN/SSN, etc.)"
  - "Track verification status and required actions"
  - "Protect your account with stronger identity checks"
- IMPORTANT: Do NOT implement upload forms or actual verification flows here yet. This remains a visual placeholder only.

10) Help Center
- title: "Help Center"
- subtitle: "Find answers to common questions about using SafeGo Eats."
- plannedCapabilities:
  - "Browse frequently asked questions"
  - "Learn how to manage orders, menus, and payouts"
  - "Get tips to improve your restaurant performance"

Responsiveness:
- Ensure `FeaturePlaceholderLayout` works well on:
  - Large desktop (current layout)
  - Small laptop
  - Tablet
  - Mobile viewports
- Use the existing design system: typography scales, spacing, and card components already used on other restaurant pages.
- Avoid horizontal scrolling: content should stack vertically and center nicely on narrow screens.

Security & UX constraints:
- No dummy forms, no fake buttons that look “active”.
- Only simple informational UI and safe navigation (e.g. back to dashboard).
- Do not expose any internal IDs or implementation details beyond what is already shown in the layout shell.

Non-breaking requirement:
- After changes, all previous phases (1–12) must remain fully functional.
- No changes to APIs, Prisma models, or back-end logic.
- Only additive frontend refactor/cleanup for the placeholder content.

Finally:
- Update any relevant documentation file (e.g. replit.md) to:
  - List which placeholder pages now use `FeaturePlaceholderLayout`
  - Confirm this is a purely presentational enhancement, safe for production.
- Run the app, navigate through each of the updated pages in restaurant mode, and verify there are no runtime errors or route issues.
