Before adding any new features, I want you to fully VERIFY and STABILIZE the Restaurant Support Center after your recent cleanup of the duplicate ticket routes.

STRICT RULES (do NOT break these):
- Do NOT add any new routes, models, or database tables.
- Do NOT change any existing API contracts used by the frontend.
- Do NOT touch global KYC/RBAC logic, auth middleware, or SafeGuard security rules.
- Only make minimal, safe fixes if you find a clear bug (for example: wrong status code, broken handler, missing null-check).
- Keep this task limited to the RESTAURANT support system only.

TASK GOAL:
Make sure the Restaurant Support Center (tickets + support pages) is production-ready and stable after the route cleanup.

A. ROUTE & CONTROLLER VERIFICATION
1. Inspect `server/routes/restaurant-support*.ts` (or similar files) and confirm:
   - There are exactly 14 active routes.
   - There are NO duplicate routes for the same path + HTTP method.
   - Each route has:
     - Proper auth + KYC/RBAC middleware.
     - Error handling (try/catch or centralized error handler).
     - Correct HTTP methods (GET/POST/PATCH for tickets).
2. For each critical route (create ticket, list tickets, view ticket, update ticket status), verify:
   - Input validation is enforced.
   - It never exposes another restaurant’s data.
   - It never leaks internal IDs or sensitive data.

B. END-TO-END FLOW CHECK (RESTAURANT USER)
Using the existing frontend (NO new pages), test these flows for a restaurant user:
1. Open the Restaurant Support Center from the restaurant portal.
2. Create a new support ticket with:
   - Subject
   - Category
   - Description
   - Optional attachment (if already supported)
3. View the ticket list and open a ticket detail.
4. Add a reply / comment to a ticket (if supported).
5. Change ticket status (open → in progress → resolved/closed) using the existing UI.
6. Confirm that:
   - All actions show correct success/failure states.
   - Nothing returns 500 errors or blank screens.
   - Ticket list updates correctly after an action.

C. UI/UX QUALITY CHECK (RESTAURANT PAGES ONLY)
On mobile, tablet, and desktop:
1. Verify layout and responsiveness for:
   - Help Center page
   - Contact Support page
   - System Status page
   - Ticket list + ticket detail views (if present)
2. Make sure:
   - No horizontal scrolling is required.
   - Text and buttons are readable and not overlapping.
   - Forms are usable on small screens (inputs not cut off, labels visible).
3. You may do SMALL, SAFE UI fixes if needed:
   - Adjust spacing, padding, or font size.
   - Fix obvious misalignment.
   - But do NOT redesign whole pages and do NOT move components to new routes.

D. SECURITY & LOGGING
1. Confirm that all Restaurant Support routes:
   - Require authenticated restaurant session.
   - Are scoped to the current restaurant’s ID.
   - Respect existing KYC/RBAC gating.
2. Verify audit logging / transaction wrapping is still working as before your cleanup (do NOT rewrite it; just confirm).
3. Ensure no support API endpoint is publicly accessible without auth.

E. SHORT IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
After all checks:
1. Summarize:
   - Which routes exist in the Restaurant Support Center (short list).
   - Which user flows you tested (create ticket, list, update, etc.).
   - Any bugs you found and what minimal fixes you applied.
2. Explicitly confirm:
   - “No new routes, models, or tables were added in this task.”
   - “All existing API contracts remain backward compatible.”
   - “KYC/RBAC and SafeGuard rules were preserved.”

This task is ONLY for verifying and stabilizing the Restaurant Support Center after removing duplicate ticket routes. Do not start building new features (like global cross-role support, new channels, or advanced analytics) in this step.
