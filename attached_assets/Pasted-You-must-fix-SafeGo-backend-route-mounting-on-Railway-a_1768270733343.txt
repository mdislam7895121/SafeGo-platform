You must fix SafeGo backend route mounting on Railway (api.safegoglobal.com) WITHOUT breaking anything.

Context / Symptoms (must reproduce first):
1) GET https://api.safegoglobal.com/api/health returns HTML: "Cannot GET /api/health"
2) POST https://api.safegoglobal.com/api/auth/signup returns HTML: "Cannot POST /api/auth/signup"
3) The server responds with headers like "X-Powered-By: Express" and "railway-edge", so Express is running but routes are not mounted.

Root cause hypothesis:
The Express app is starting but the file that registers routes (e.g., registerRoutes(app) or app.use("/api", routes)) is not being executed in production, or Railway is running the wrong entrypoint/build output.

Hard rules (non-breaking):
- Do NOT change any existing API paths.
- Keep /api/auth/signup and /api/auth/login exactly the same.
- Do NOT modify database schema.
- Do NOT refactor business logic.
- Make only minimal, additive changes to ensure routes mount reliably in production.
- Add a minimal GET /api/health that returns JSON: { "status": "ok" } with Content-Type: application/json.
- Ensure JSON body parsing is enabled (express.json()).
- Ensure CORS allows the Netlify frontend origin(s) and localhost for dev.
- Ensure errors return JSON, not HTML, for API routes.

What you must do (step-by-step):
A) Locate the actual server entrypoint used in production:
   - Check package.json scripts (start, build) and Railway settings.
   - Identify whether it runs dist/index.js, build/index.js, server.js, etc.
B) Ensure route registration is called BEFORE listen():
   - If there is a function like registerRoutes(app), it MUST be imported and executed.
   - If routes are in a router file, ensure app.use("/api", router) is executed.
C) Add GET /api/health safely:
   - Implement app.get("/api/health", ...) returning JSON.
D) Add minimal diagnostics logs (one-time):
   - Log the mounted base path and environment at startup.
   - Log "Routes mounted" after route registration.
E) Commit and push to main so Railway redeploys.

Verification (must provide exact commands and expected outputs):
1) PowerShell (use curl.exe explicitly):
   - curl.exe -i https://api.safegoglobal.com/api/health
   Expected: HTTP 200 and JSON {"status":"ok"}
2) Signup (POST):
   - curl.exe -i -X POST https://api.safegoglobal.com/api/auth/signup `
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
     -d "{\"email\":\"test+railway@safego.com\",\"password\":\"123456\"}"
   Expected: JSON response (either success or a JSON error), but NOT HTML "Cannot POST".
3) Login (POST):
   - curl.exe -i -X POST https://api.safegoglobal.com/api/auth/login `
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
     -d "{\"email\":\"test+railway@safego.com\",\"password\":\"123456\"}"
   Expected: JSON response, not HTML.

Deliverables you must output:
- The exact files changed, with small diffs.
- Why each change is safe/non-breaking.
- The final test results (status codes + JSON snippet).
