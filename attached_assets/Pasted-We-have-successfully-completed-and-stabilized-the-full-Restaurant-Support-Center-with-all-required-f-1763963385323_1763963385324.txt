We have successfully completed and stabilized the full Restaurant Support Center with all required features (Live Chat, Phone Callbacks, Email/Ticketing, Help Center Articles, Audit Logging, RBAC, KYC, SafeGuard). Now extend this support system to all other SafeGo roles while keeping all existing rules, security requirements, and backward compatibility untouched.

Your tasks:

1. Enable Support Center access for these roles:
   - driver
   - customer
   - admin

2. For each role, create their own secure support namespace:
   - /api/driver/support-center/*
   - /api/customer/support-center/*
   - /api/admin/support-center/*

3. All support features must be available for all roles:
   - Live Chat
   - Phone Callback
   - Ticketing (create, list, view, reply)
   - Help Center Articles (search, view, list categories)

4. Enforce role-specific RBAC:
   - driver → requireRole(["driver"])
   - customer → requireRole(["customer"])
   - admin → requireRole(["admin"])

5. Enforce KYC & SafeGuard rules exactly the same way as Restaurant:
   - isVerified + verificationStatus === "APPROVED"
   - apply SafeGuard rules for data privacy
   - prevent cross-role data access
   - proper session scoping

6. Reuse the same internal support service logic:
   - No new models or database tables
   - No breaking schema changes
   - No duplication of code
   - Only extend routing with correct namespacing

7. UI/UX:
   - Ensure mobile, tablet, and desktop responsive layouts work across all roles
   - Each role gets a support hub inside their own dashboard
   - Follow the same design, spacing, and interaction patterns used in Restaurant Support Center

8. Perform full system checks:
   - Route validation
   - Role-based isolation
   - Live Chat message flow for all roles
   - Phone callback request flow
   - Ticket creation + replies across all roles
   - Article browsing
   - Audit logging verification
   - Security verification (RBAC, KYC, SafeGuard)
   - Production readiness and architect review

Comply with all SafeGo rules, do not break any existing feature, and ensure backward compatibility. 
Proceed with full implementation.
