SAFEGO GLOBAL MASTER RULES (MUST FOLLOW, NO BREAKING CHANGES)

A) ROLES – keep 4 separate roles
1. customer
2. driver
3. restaurant (merchant)
4. admin

Each role keeps its own:
- signup/onboarding flow
- KYC/verification rules
- dashboard
- permissions
- status flows

Public signup is CUSTOMER ONLY.  
Drivers/restaurants/admins onboard after login.  
Never mix role access or KYC data between roles.

B) SERVICES – always support 3
1. Ride-hailing
2. Food delivery
3. Parcel delivery

Any change must NOT break existing ride/food/parcel flows.

C) COUNTRY-SPECIFIC KYC

C.1 Bangladesh (BD) driver KYC fields (must exist, do not rename/delete):
- father_name
- date_of_birth
- present_address
- permanent_address
- nid_number
- nid_front_image_url
- nid_back_image_url
- emergency_contact_name
- emergency_contact_phone
- verification_status
- is_verified

C.2 United States (US) base KYC:
- date_of_birth
- home_address (street, city, state, zip)
- emergency_contact_name
- emergency_contact_phone
- government_id_type
- government_id_last4
- verification_status
- is_verified

C.3 US DRIVERS extra:
- driver_license_number
- driver_license_state
- driver_license_expiry
- driver_license_front_image_url
- driver_license_back_image_url
- ssn_last4 (optional)
- TLC zone (NYC 5 boroughs):
  - tlc_license_number
  - tlc_license_expiry
  - tlc_license_front_image_url
  - tlc_license_back_image_url
  - any existing TLC training/medical/exam/drug-test fields

Do NOT rename or delete these fields. Only ADD new ones if needed.

D) ADMIN PANEL – must stay working
Admin must still:
- verify customers/drivers/restaurants
- approve/reject KYC, view rejection_reason
- update pricing, fees, commissions
- block/unblock any user
- manage payouts
- view negative balances for drivers and restaurants

E) CORE COLLECTIONS – keep rides, food_orders, deliveries
Each collection must keep:
- identity (customer_id, driver_id, restaurant_id…)
- addresses + geolocation
- fees + commission breakdown
- payment details (cash/online, transaction_id, method)
- status timestamps
- rating and feedback

F) COMMISSION & PAYOUT RULES
1. Ride CASH:
   - Driver keeps full cash.
   - SafeGo commission becomes negative driver_wallet_balance.
   - Driver settles weekly.

2. Food CASH:
   - Restaurant keeps cash.
   - Commission becomes negative restaurant_wallet.

3. ONLINE:
   - SafeGo keeps commission automatically.

4. Admin can settle balances and mark them paid.

G) SECURITY
- Customers cannot see driver documents (NID, license, TLC).
- Drivers cannot see customer KYC/NID.
- Restaurants cannot see other restaurants.
- Only admin can change pricing, commission, verification, blocking.
- Users can update only their own profile.

H) STATUS FLOWS – keep intact
Rides:
  requested → searching_driver → accepted → driver_arriving → in_progress → completed or cancelled_x

Food:
  placed → accepted → preparing → ready_for_pickup → picked_up → on_the_way → delivered or cancelled_x

Parcel:
  requested → searching_driver → accepted → picked_up → on_the_way → delivered or cancelled_x

I) ONBOARDING
- Public signup = simple customer account.
- Partners onboard after login: basic info → address → KYC → emergency contacts.
- verification_status starts "pending"; access blocked until admin approves.

J) NOTIFICATIONS
Keep notifications for:
- new ride alerts
- food/parcel updates
- KYC approval/rejection
- important admin messages

All changes must be ADDITIVE and NON-BREAKING.

=====================================================
CONTEXT: V1 REMOVED FROM ROUTES, V2 IS ACTIVE
=====================================================

You already:
- Removed V1 from routing so `/partner/driver/register?type=ride` uses ONLY the V2 driver onboarding.
- Updated some bindings with `{...field}`.

Current bug (verified now):

- On `/partner/driver/register?type=ride`:
  - After completing Personal Information and clicking Next:
    - Driver License fields are EMPTY (good).
    - BUT when I click/tap "Driver License Number" and type, NOTHING appears.
    - The field focuses, but keystrokes do not change the value.

So the inputs are rendered but effectively READ-ONLY.  
We need you to **simplify** the driver license inputs in V2 to pure HTML inputs directly bound to React Hook Form, with NO shadcn FormControl / Radix Slot wrappers.

ONLY V2 needs this change. V1 must remain unused but intact in the codebase.

=====================================================
TASK: REPLACE V2 DRIVER LICENSE INPUTS WITH PURE HTML INPUTS
=====================================================

1) Open the V2 driver onboarding file used for `/partner/driver/register?type=ride`, e.g.:
   - `client/src/pages/partner/driver-registration-v2.tsx`
   or the file where the V2 driver onboarding component lives.

2) Find the JSX for the Driver License step that renders:
   - Driver License Number
   - License Issuing State
   - License Expiration Date

Right now these likely use shadcn `Input` + `FormControl` wrappers.

We want to temporarily replace them with **plain HTML elements** wired directly to React Hook Form like this:

-------------------------------------------------
2.1 DRIVER LICENSE NUMBER (TEXT INPUT)
-------------------------------------------------

Replace the current license number input with something equivalent to:

```tsx
<Controller
  name="driver_license_number"
  control={control}
  render={({ field }) => (
    <input
      type="text"
      id="license-number-field"
      autoComplete="off"
      {...field}
      className="w-full rounded-md border px-3 py-2 text-sm" // reuse your existing classes
    />
  )}
/>
