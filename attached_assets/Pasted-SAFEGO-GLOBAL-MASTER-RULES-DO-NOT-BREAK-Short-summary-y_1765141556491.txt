SAFEGO GLOBAL MASTER RULES – DO NOT BREAK

(Short summary, you must preserve all existing behavior.)

A) Roles (4 roles)
1. customer
2. driver
3. restaurant (merchant)
4. admin

Each role has its own signup/onboarding, KYC, dashboard, permissions, status flows.
Public signup is CUSTOMER ONLY; drivers/restaurants/admins onboard after login.
Do not mix role access.

B) Services (3 services)
- Ride-hailing
- Food delivery
- Parcel delivery
Driver onboarding changes must NOT break any ride/food/parcel flows.

C) Country-specific KYC
- BD driver KYC: father_name, date_of_birth, present_address, permanent_address, NID (number + images), emergency contact, verification_status, is_verified.
- US KYC: date_of_birth, home_address, emergency contacts, government_id_type, government_id_last4, verification_status, is_verified.
- US drivers EXTRA: driver_license_number/state/expiry, license front/back images, optional ssn_last4, TLC fields for NYC zone.

Do NOT rename/remove any of these fields.

D) Admin panel
Admin must still verify users, approve/reject KYC, see rejection_reason, manage pricing/fees/commissions, block/unblock, manage payouts, view negative balances.

E) Collections
Keep rides, food_orders, deliveries collections with identity, addresses+geo, fees+commission, payments, timestamps, rating+feedback.

F) Commission & payouts
- Cash ride → driver keeps cash, commission → negative driver_wallet_balance.
- Cash food → restaurant keeps cash, commission → negative restaurant_wallet.
- Online payments → SafeGo keeps commission automatically.
- Admin can settle & mark paid.

G) Security
No cross-role KYC visibility, only admin can change pricing/commission/verification/blocking, users edit only their own profile.

H) Status flows
Keep full status flows for rides/food/deliveries unchanged.

I) Onboarding
Customer signup simple; partners onboard after login with multi-step flow and verification_status="pending" until approved.

J) Notifications
Keep all existing notifications (rides, orders, parcels, KYC decisions, admin messages).

All changes must be additive and NON-BREAKING.

====================================================
NOW: DRIVER LICENSE INPUTS ARE EMPTY BUT NOT TYPABLE
====================================================

Current behavior at `/partner/driver/register?type=ride` (US driver onboarding):

- After completing Personal Information and clicking Next:
  - Driver License fields now start EMPTY (good).
  - However, on the Driver License step:
    - I can focus the "Driver License Number" field, but typing on the keyboard does NOTHING.
    - The value does not change at all.
- This happens on desktop and mobile.

So the bug now is:
> The inputs render but are effectively READ-ONLY / not bound to form state properly.

You must now debug and fix the input bindings at the component level for the V2 driver onboarding form (and mirror the fix to V1 if necessary).

====================================================
1. DEBUG THE V2 DRIVER LICENSE INPUT COMPONENT
====================================================

1.1 Open the V2 Driver License step component used for `/partner/driver/register?type=ride` when `driver_onboarding_v2` is true.

Look specifically at the JSX that renders:

- Driver License Number
- License Issuing State
- License Expiration Date

1.2 Confirm how you are integrating with React Hook Form (or your form library):

For example, with Controller:

```tsx
<Controller
  name="driver_license_number"
  control={control}
  render={({ field }) => (
    <Input
      {...field}
      /* DO NOT override value/onChange below without using field */
    />
  )}
/>
