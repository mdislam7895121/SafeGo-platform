ROLE: Senior Full-Stack Engineer & Admin Panel Auditor

PROJECT: SafeGo Admin Panel (Web)

OBJECTIVE (STRICT):
Audit the ENTIRE Admin Panel end-to-end and FIX ALL ISSUES.
If ANY admin page is broken, missing, crashing, or partially working — it is considered FAILURE.

SCOPE (ADMIN ONLY — DO NOT TOUCH CUSTOMER / DRIVER / MAP / RIDE UI):

1) ROUTING & 404 ISSUES (CRITICAL)
- Scan every admin sidebar menu item.
- Ensure EVERY route exists and loads:
  /admin
  /admin/dashboard
  /admin/users
  /admin/drivers
  /admin/restaurants
  /admin/parcels
  /admin/wallets
  /admin/payouts
  /admin/kyc
  /admin/onboarding
  /admin/onboarding-overview
  /admin/bd-expansion
  /admin/cms-pages
  /admin/settings
- ZERO admin route may show:
  - 404 Page Not Found
  - Blank screen
  - “Did you forget to add the page to the router?”

2) SIDEBAR & LAYOUT (CRITICAL)
- Sidebar must NOT jump, auto-scroll, or reset position.
- Sidebar scroll must be independent of page content.
- Layout must be stable on refresh and navigation.
- No layout shift on route change.

3) CMS / CONTENT PAGES (CRITICAL)
- Fix “Failed to load pages”
- Fix Select / SelectItem empty value crash.
- CMS Pages must:
  - Load list
  - Create new page
  - Edit page
  - Save page
  - Delete page
- No red error banners.
- No console errors.

4) ADMIN AUTH & API HANDLING
- If not logged in → clean “Authentication required” state.
- If logged in → data must load.
- No silent failures.
- All API errors must show readable admin-friendly messages.

5) TYPESCRIPT & RUNTIME ERRORS
- Remove all runtime crashes.
- Fix all TypeScript errors in admin pages.
- No `any` hacks unless unavoidable (explain why if used).

6) ERROR HANDLING STANDARD
- Replace raw error dumps with:
  - Friendly UI message
  - Retry option
  - Proper fallback component

7) FINAL VERIFICATION (MANDATORY)
You MUST:
- Manually open every admin menu item
- Confirm NO 404
- Confirm NO crash
- Confirm NO blank page
- Confirm sidebar stability

8) DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS
- Provide a clear checklist:
  ✅ Page name → Working
- Mention any page that was missing and added.
- Mention any route that was fixed.
- If ANY admin page still fails → state clearly “ADMIN NOT READY”.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Do NOT touch customer, driver, ride, map, pricing, or UI polish.
- Do NOT add new features.
- ONLY fix what is broken.
- Quality > speed.
- This is a PAID audit — partial fixes are NOT acceptable.

FINAL OUTPUT FORMAT:
1. Summary of issues found
2. Exact fixes applied
3. Confirmation: “Admin panel fully stable” OR “Admin panel still broken (list reasons)”

START ONLY AFTER FULL ADMIN AUDIT.
