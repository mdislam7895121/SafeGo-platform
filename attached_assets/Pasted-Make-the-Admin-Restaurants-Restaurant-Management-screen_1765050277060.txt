Make the Admin > Restaurants > Restaurant Management screen fully responsive by device size, without breaking any SafeGo logic, routes, roles, KYC, or database schema.

1) Global layout
- Keep the current design system (glow cards, filters, table) but make it adapt to screen width.
- Use a responsive layout approach: flex/grid + CSS breakpoints instead of fixed pixel widths.

2) Breakpoints
Implement at least these breakpoints:
- Desktop: >= 1280px
- Laptop: 1024–1279px
- Tablet: 768–1023px
- Mobile: < 768px (can be prepared, even if the admin is mainly desktop).

3) Search & Filters card
- Desktop/Laptop: keep current padding and layout.
- Tablet:
  - Reduce horizontal padding slightly.
  - Stack fields vertically if there is not enough width.
- Mobile:
  - All filters stack in a single column.
  - Keep glow and radius but reduce padding so it fits well on small screens.

4) Restaurants table – desktop & laptop
- Table container stays full-width with horizontal scroll inside the wrapper (no clipping).
- On laptop widths:
  - Slightly reduce column padding (left/right) so more content fits.
  - Long text in cells should use text-overflow: ellipsis, not break layout.
  - Keep all important columns visible via scroll (Restaurant, Email, Country, KYC, Status, Commission).

5) Restaurants table – tablet
- Show only the most important columns directly:
  - Restaurant, Email, Country, Status.
- Hide less important columns (Commission, created_at, etc.) by default and expose them via:
  - the Columns toggle, or
  - a "View details" / "More" action on each row.
- Ensure the Restaurant column remains sticky on the left when scrolling horizontally.

6) (Optional) Mobile behavior
- For screen widths < 768px:
  - Render restaurants as stacked list cards instead of a wide table.
  - Each card shows:
      - Restaurant name + address
      - Email (shortened if long)
      - Country
      - KYC + Status badges
      - A "View details" or chevron to open a detail view (drawer / modal) with all other fields.
  - Keep the same glow-card style for each row card.

7) Columns button
- The Columns button must remain visible on laptop and tablet.
- Ensure any hidden columns are controlled through this button and not by clipping off-screen.

8) Typography & spacing
- Adjust font sizes slightly at smaller breakpoints (e.g., -1px) so text stays readable without overflowing.
- Use consistent vertical spacing (8/16/24px) at all sizes; just scale padding down on smaller devices.

9) Testing
- Test Restaurant Management screen at:
  - 1440px (desktop)
  - ~1280px (laptop)
  - 1024px (tablet landscape)
  - 768px (tablet portrait)
- Verify:
  - No headers are partially visible (e.g., “Com”).
  - Horizontal scroll reveals all columns on desktop/laptop where needed.
  - On tablet/mobile, layout is usable and not cut off.
  - Glow cards, filters, and table/list remain visually consistent with the rest of the Admin panel.

Goal:
The Restaurant Management page should look clean and professional on any device size: on large screens as a full table with scroll, and on smaller screens as a compact, readable, responsive layout with no clipped columns.
