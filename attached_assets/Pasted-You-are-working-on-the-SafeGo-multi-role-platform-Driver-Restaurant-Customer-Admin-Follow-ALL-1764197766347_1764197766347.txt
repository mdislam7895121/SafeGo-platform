You are working on the SafeGo multi-role platform (Driver, Restaurant, Customer, Admin). 
Follow ALL existing SafeGo master rules, security roadmap phases, KYC rules for BD/US, 
and the unified payout system architecture that is already implemented. 
Do NOT break any existing functionality. Only extend and refine.

TASK: Enhance the “Add Payout Method” flow so drivers and restaurant owners can choose 
their preferred payout option from a proper dropdown, and add a clear “Account Type” 
selection for bank payouts.

Scope and constraints:
1) Do NOT change any core payout business rules:
   - Unified /api/payout/* backend already exists and is production-ready for individual payouts.
   - Keep existing models (Payout, PayoutAccount, PayoutBatch) and KYC / RBAC checks as they are.
   - Keep minimum payout amounts, country-specific rules, and encryption exactly as implemented.

2) Payout Type dropdown requirements:
   - In the Add Payout Method UI for DRIVER and RESTAURANT roles, update the “Payout Type” 
     select so it supports all configured payout methods in the unified system:
       • Bank Account
       • Mobile Wallet (for Bangladesh: bKash, Nagad, Rocket, others if already defined)
       • Stripe / External Provider (for USA or global, only if already present in the codebase)
   - Use a clean, user-friendly label set, for example:
       - "Bank Account"
       - "Mobile Wallet"
       - "Stripe Connect" (or existing label already used in the app)
   - Respect country restrictions:
       - Bangladesh: Bank Account + Mobile Wallet are allowed.
       - USA: Bank Account + Stripe (or equivalent) are allowed.
       - If any payout type is not allowed for the user’s country, hide or disable it in the dropdown.
   - Ensure the dropdown is driven from a shared type/enum (e.g. PayoutMethodType) so 
     both frontend and backend use the same values.

3) Account Type dropdown for bank payouts:
   - For Bank Account payout type ONLY, show an “Account Type” dropdown with options such as:
       • Checking
       • Savings
       • Business Checking
       • Business Savings
       • Other
   - Persist the accountType field in the correct model that stores payout account details.
     Re-use any existing field if already present; otherwise, extend the model carefully.
   - Add proper validation:
       - accountType is REQUIRED when payoutType === "bank".
       - accountType must be one of the allowed enum values.
   - If payoutType is NOT "bank" (Mobile Wallet / Stripe), hide or disable the Account Type 
     control and do not require it in validation.

4) Mobile Wallet and other payout fields:
   - When payoutType === "Mobile Wallet":
       - Show the correct wallet provider selection (e.g., bKash, Nagad, Rocket, etc.)
       - Show a mobile wallet number field instead of bank routing/account fields if that 
         pattern already exists in the project.
   - When payoutType === "Stripe" (or other external provider):
       - Follow the existing integration pattern (e.g., token, external ID), do not invent 
         new flows.
   - Make sure the form only shows the fields relevant to the currently selected payout type.

5) UI/UX requirements:
   - Apply these changes to:
       - Driver: /driver/account/payout-methods Add Payout Method modal/page
       - Restaurant: /restaurant/account/payout-methods Add Payout Method modal/page
   - Keep styling, spacing, and button layout consistent with the rest of the SafeGo UI.
   - Add short helper text under the Account Type dropdown, e.g. 
     “Select the type of bank account (checking, savings, or business).”
   - Handle validation errors with clear messages (no raw JSON errors).

6) Backend & API alignment:
   - Ensure the payload sent from the frontend matches the backend expectations for each payout type:
       - Bank: accountHolderName, accountNumber, routingNumber, bankName, accountType, country.
       - Mobile Wallet: provider, walletNumber, country.
       - Stripe/Other: use the existing fields already defined in the unified payout system.
   - Update TypeScript interfaces (frontend and backend) so they stay in sync.
   - Preserve AES-256-GCM encryption and any other security constraints for sensitive fields.
   - Do NOT touch batch payout logic or admin-only routes.

7) Security and KYC:
   - Keep all existing KYC gating:
       - Only verified and approved users can add/activate payout methods.
       - Respect the existing “pending verification” states for payout accounts if present.
   - Ensure rate limiting and audit logging stay intact for payout-related endpoints.

8) Testing and verification:
   - Manually verify in the browser:
       - Driver > Account > Payout Methods > Add Method:
           * Selecting Bank Account shows Account Type dropdown and bank fields.
           * Selecting Mobile Wallet shows wallet provider + wallet number, hides Account Type.
           * Selecting Stripe/other shows the correct fields and hides Account Type.
       - Restaurant > Account > Payout Methods > Add Method behaves the same.
   - Confirm that:
       - New methods save successfully for each payout type.
       - Data is correctly persisted and reloaded in the payout methods list.
       - No TypeScript errors or runtime errors are introduced.

9) Documentation:
   - Update replit.md or the relevant project documentation section to briefly describe:
       - The supported payout types per country.
       - The meaning and allowed values of accountType.
       - Any differences between Driver and Restaurant payout options.

When you are done, summarize exactly what was changed (files, components, models), 
and confirm that the existing unified payout system remains stable and production-ready.
