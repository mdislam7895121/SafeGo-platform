ADMIN PANEL FULL AUDIT & FIX — STRICT TASK

You are assigned to perform a COMPLETE ADMIN PANEL AUDIT AND FIX for the SafeGo platform.
This is NOT a feature request. This is a mandatory bug-fix and stability task.

==============================
1. SCOPE (ALL ADMIN PAGES)
==============================
You must audit and fix EVERY admin page, including but not limited to:

/admin
/admin/dashboard
/admin/bd-expansion
/admin/onboarding-overview
/admin/cms-pages
/admin/partners
/admin/drivers
/admin/settings
/admin/promotions
/admin/pricing
/admin/analytics
ALL routes linked from the admin sidebar

==============================
2. CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX
==============================

A) ROUTING & 404 ERRORS
- Multiple admin pages return 404 Page Not Found
- Sidebar links exist but routes are missing or broken

REQUIREMENTS:
- Every admin menu item MUST have a valid route
- No /admin/* route may return 404
- Either properly implement missing routes or remove dead links cleanly
- Router configuration must match sidebar exactly

------------------------------

B) SIDEBAR & LAYOUT BUG
- Sidebar scrolls upward and loses position
- Admin layout breaks while scrolling
- Content and sidebar scroll together incorrectly

REQUIREMENTS:
- Sidebar must be fixed or sticky
- Main content must scroll independently
- No layout jump, overflow bug, or scroll reset

------------------------------

C) CMS PAGE CRASH
Current error on /admin/cms-pages:
<SelectItem /> must have a value prop that is not an empty string

REQUIREMENTS:
- CMS page must load without crashing
- All Select components must have valid default values
- Empty string values must be handled safely
- No runtime error in admin UI

------------------------------

D) ONBOARDING ADMIN PAGES
- /admin/onboarding-overview returns 404
- Partner onboarding admin pages are broken or missing

REQUIREMENTS:
- All onboarding-related admin pages must open correctly
- No dead routes
- No placeholder or fake pages

==============================
3. QUALITY RULES (STRICT)
==============================
- No placeholders
- No “working later”
- No partial fixes
- No console errors
- Everything must ACTUALLY load and function

==============================
4. VERIFICATION (MANDATORY)
==============================
After fixing:
- Manually visit EVERY admin route
- Confirm:
  - No 404
  - No crashes
  - Sidebar stable
  - CMS usable
- Provide a final checklist confirming each admin page works

==============================
5. PAYMENT & REFUND CLAUSE
==============================
If ANY admin page still:
- Shows 404
- Crashes
- Has broken routing
- Has unstable sidebar/layout

Then this task is considered FAILED,
and ALL previous admin-related payments must be REFUNDED.

==============================
6. DELIVERY
==============================
You must deliver:
1) Fully working admin panel
2) Stable routing
3) Fixed sidebar behavior
4) Error-free CMS pages
5) Final confirmation report

IMPORTANT:
Do NOT touch customer app, ride flow, maps, pricing logic, or UI features.
FOCUS ONLY on ADMIN PANEL stability and correctness.
