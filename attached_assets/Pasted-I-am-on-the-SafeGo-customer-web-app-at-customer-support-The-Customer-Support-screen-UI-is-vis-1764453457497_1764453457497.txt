I am on the SafeGo customer web app at /customer/support.

The "Customer → Support" screen UI is visible:
- Left side: "Verify Your Details" card with my name, masked phone, total trips counter, and a checkbox to confirm.
- A "Start Chat" primary button under the verification card.
- Right side: "Start Live Support" panel with info text.
- Footer text: "SafeGo Support is available 24/7 – Typical response time: under 2 minutes."

The problem:
- None of the controls respond. Checking the box or clicking "Start Chat" does nothing.
- I need a working Uber-style live support contact flow, not just a static screen.

Your tasks:

1. **Wire up the /customer/support page**
   - Locate the customer support page component (likely `client/src/pages/customer/support.tsx` or similar).
   - Fix any missing `onClick` handlers or state so that:
     - The verification checkbox toggles a `isVerifiedForSupport` state.
     - The "Start Chat" button is disabled until the user is verified, then becomes enabled.
   - When the user clicks "Start Chat":
     - If they are not logged in, show an auth-required message and redirect to login.
     - If they are logged in and verified, open the **live support chat** panel.

2. **Connect to the existing Support Center / chat components**
   - Reuse the Support Center features that are already marked [DONE] in the status table:
     - multi-page support center (tickets, live-chat, articles, contact)
   - Embed or navigate to a proper chat view (for example: `/customer/support/chat` or an in-page `<SupportChatPanel />`).
   - The chat view must include:
     - Conversation history list (messages with timestamps and who sent them: customer vs support).
     - A text input box and "Send" button.
     - Basic typing state and auto-scroll to the latest message.

   If there is no real backend yet:
   - Implement a **safe demo mode**:
     - Store messages in local state (or a lightweight store) per session.
     - Simulate a short support reply (e.g., canned responses) so the customer sees that chat works.
   - Keep the architecture ready to plug in a real backend later (e.g., WebSocket or polling API), but do NOT add any external services.

3. **Entry points and navigation**
   - Ensure the support chat is reachable from all three entry points mentioned earlier:
     1) From an active ride (e.g., "Need help?" or "Contact support" button on the active ride panel).
     2) From the completed trip receipt page.
     3) From the profile / support menu.
   - All of these should route to the same support screen and preserve context (for example, include the current `rideId` or `orderId` in the header so support can see what the user is asking about).

4. **Security, privacy, and safety requirements**
   - Only authenticated customers can start live chat.
   - Do NOT expose internal IDs like driver earnings or admin-only info in the chat context.
   - Mask sensitive fields (phone, email) consistently – show full to the user, but only send what is needed to support APIs.
   - Log support contact events in a safe way (e.g., one log entry per chat session) without saving any secrets in the frontend code.
   - Add basic rate-limiting on the client side: prevent spamming the "Send" button (e.g., simple debounce or cooldown).
   - Respect existing SafeGo role and visibility rules – support chat must *not* allow switching roles or reading driver/admin data.

5. **UX polish**
   - Make sure the "Start Chat" button has clear states:
     - Disabled with tooltip or helper text when not verified.
     - Loading state while initializing a chat session.
     - Then replaced by the actual chat panel or a "Back to support" link.
   - Show error toasts if something fails instead of silently doing nothing.
   - Keep the overall design consistent with the existing SafeGo theme (no new design system).

6. **Regression checks**
   - Do NOT break any of the following that are already [DONE]:
     - SafeGo Ride booking, trip receipts, and rating dialog.
     - Live driver tracking and customer GPS marker.
     - Wallet, KYC, notifications, or Activity/History.
   - Verify:
     - /customer still loads correctly.
     - /customer/support works on both desktop and mobile preview.
     - Clicking support from an active ride or trip receipt leads to a functional live chat.

When you finish:
- Run the architect review.
- Confirm in your report that the support chat is working end-to-end in demo mode, and that the "Verify details" + "Start Chat" UI is fully interactive and no longer dead.
