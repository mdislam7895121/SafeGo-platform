Act as a senior product designer and full-stack engineer for SafeGo.

Goal: Finish and refine the Driver KYC Documents page so that every required document has its own upload box directly under the document name, consistent with Uber’s document UX.

Follow all existing SafeGo conventions:
- Four roles: customer, driver, restaurant, admin.
- Keep all existing KYC, payouts, rides, and vehicle logic intact.
- Do NOT touch ride, food, or parcel flows.
- Do NOT break any existing URLs, APIs, or database collections.
- Collections such as drivers, vehicles, documents, payouts, rides, food_orders, deliveries must remain compatible.

Scope: Driver Account Center → Account Settings → Driver Requirements → Documents
Route: /driver/kyc-documents (do not change the route)

Current behavior:
- “Documents” card opens the KYC page.
- DMV Driver License section already exists with a single upload box.
- Vehicle Documents section currently has only:
  - Registration Document (upload box)
  - Insurance Document (upload box)

Required changes:

1) Keep existing layout
- Keep the page header, section titles, spacing, and typography exactly as they are.
- Maintain the white background, grey dividers, and card-style layout.
- Do not change any existing copy unless explicitly specified.

2) Driver License section
- Section title: “DMV Driver License”
- Keep the existing upload area but ensure:
  - The upload box is visually and structurally tied to the “DMV License Image” label.
  - Max file size text stays below the box (5MB).
- For all future driver-identity documents, follow the same pattern:
  - Document label
  - Helper text (if needed)
  - Directly under it: one upload box with dashed border, icon, and “Click to upload …” text.

3) Vehicle Documents section – expand and align

Under the “Vehicle Documents” section, we now need the following document types, each with its own upload area:

A. Registration Document
- Label: “Registration Document”
- Helper: “Upload vehicle registration”
- Keep the existing upload box and align it directly under this label.

B. Insurance Document
- Label: “Insurance Document”
- Helper: “Upload insurance certificate”
- Keep the existing upload box and align it directly under this label.

C. Vehicle Inspection
- Label: “Vehicle Inspection”
- Helper: “Upload official inspection report”
- New upload box under this label (same style, same component as Registration/Insurance).
- Max size: 10MB.

D. Driver License (Vehicle Section)
- Label: “Driver License”
- Helper: “Upload a clear photo of your driver license”
- New upload box under this label (same component).
- This is separate from the DMV License section, because this card is grouped under Vehicle Documents.

E. License Plate
- Label: “License Plate”
- Helper: “Upload a clear photo showing the plate number”
- New upload box under this label.

F. TLC License (NYC only)
- Label: “TLC License”
- Helper: “Required for New York TLC drivers”
- New upload box under this label.
- Visibility rule:
  - Show and require this document only for drivers whose operating city is New York (or a TLC-eligible city flag).
  - Hide it for other countries/cities.

G. TLC Diamond (NYC only)
- Label: “TLC Diamond”
- Helper: “Upload a clear photo of the TLC Diamond/medallion”
- New upload box under this label.
- Same visibility rule as TLC License (NYC drivers only).

Implementation rules for all document upload boxes:
- Each document type must have:
  - Title (document name)
  - Optional helper/description text
  - Directly below it: one upload area with:
    - Dashed border card
    - Image/file icon
    - Text: “Click to upload [document name]”
    - Max size text (5MB or 10MB, consistent with current implementation)
- Use the existing SafeGo document upload component (do NOT invent a new uploader).
- Preserve the existing document status system (Pending / Approved / Rejected) if already implemented.
- Do not introduce any modal-only uploads; uploads should be accessible from this page directly.

4) Data model and backend
- Reuse the existing driver document collection and schema if possible.
- Add new document types (vehicleInspection, driverLicenseVehicle, licensePlate, tlcLicense, tlcDiamond) using the same pattern as registration/insurance.
- Ensure:
  - Each new document type is linked to the correct driver and, where relevant, to the specific vehicle.
  - Country/city conditions (for TLC License and TLC Diamond) are enforced server-side as well.
  - Existing uploads and statuses for Registration and Insurance remain untouched.

5) Validation and UX
- At least one registration document must be required (keep current rule).
- For NYC drivers:
  - Require TLC License and TLC Diamond before allowing KYC completion.
- Show inline errors below the corresponding upload box if a required document is missing or exceeds file size.
- Keep navigation breadcrumbs and “Back to Profile” link exactly as-is.

Deliverable:
- Updated /driver/kyc-documents page with all the above document types.
- All document labels with their own directly-attached upload boxes.
- No broken routes, no changes to ride/payout logic, and full compatibility with existing SafeGo KYC and document systems.
