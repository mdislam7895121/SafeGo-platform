You’ve already implemented the Uber-style Tax & Fees configuration backend and admin UI for SafeGo. The TaxRule model, API routes, and the “Tax & Fees” tab under /admin/settings are working, but there are currently no tax rules configured.

Task:
1. Do NOT change any existing payout, wallet, or earnings logic that was previously approved as production-ready.
2. Using the existing TaxRule model and the Tax & Fees settings UI only, create a safe set of initial Uber-style tax rules, so that I can test the feature without breaking anything.

Design the rules with these principles:
- Support multiple jurisdictions:
  - USA: at least rules for New York City (NYC) and San Francisco (SF)
  - Bangladesh: rules for Dhaka
- Support multiple services:
  - Rides, Food delivery, Parcels
- Tax structure:
  - Percent-based tax on the fare amount (e.g. 8–15% ranges, you can pick realistic demo values)
  - Optional fixed booking/service fee per trip/order (small flat amount)
- Fields per rule:
  - countryCode, optional city, serviceType (ride/food/parcel), taxType (percentage or flat), rate/value, isActive, appliesTo (driver/restaurant/platform/customer) based on how you designed TaxRule
- Security:
  - All reads/writes must respect existing RBAC and jurisdiction filtering
  - Validate all inputs server-side and reject invalid rules

Steps:
1. Inspect the existing TaxRule model, tax service, and settings API to confirm how rules are stored and applied.
2. Seed a small, well-structured set of demo tax rules via a safe script or migration, marked with any existing isDemo flag if available.
3. Make sure the admin “Tax & Fees” tab loads these rules, allows editing, and uses safeNumber/safeString style helpers where needed to avoid crashes.
4. Verify:
   - No errors in server logs or browser console when viewing or editing tax rules.
   - Existing payouts, wallets, earnings, and analytics remain unchanged except for reading the new tax configuration where already wired.
5. Update replit.md:
   - Document the Tax & Fees system
   - Describe fields for each rule
   - Explain how to safely add/modify/delete tax rules for new countries or cities.

Do not refactor any other parts of the system. Keep changes minimal, configuration-driven, and fully backward compatible with the current production-ready payout and analytics logic.
