You are the lead engineer responsible for preparing the SafeGo platform for publish/production.

Goal:
Give me a clear, honest RELEASE READINESS REPORT for the entire SafeGo app and then fix only the blocking issues for a first public launch (MVP). Do NOT break any working features.

Context (what already exists – verify all of this):
1) Driver side
   - Driver dashboard (stats, warnings, trips, rating, earnings widgets)
   - Driver profile + public profile view
   - Account Settings: personal info, address (edit + save), documents, tax info
   - Wallet: balance, payouts list, payout methods (bank, debit card, checking/savings)
   - Tax Info: US 1099 + Bangladesh tax summaries (auto based on driver country)
   - Identity & documents: USA (SSN last 4, license, background, etc), BD (NID last 4, docs)
   - SafeGo Points & Tiers (Blue / Gold / Premium) with 90-day rules and time-based points
   - Online/offline card removed from dashboard as per latest spec
   - Live Support chat (bot-first, full intent engine) for driver

2) Customer / rider side (if present in this repo)
   - Booking / trips flow
   - Wallet / payments
   - Support chat

3) Restaurant / parcel / courier (if present)
   - Basic dashboards
   - Orders / deliveries
   - Support chat

4) Global support system (very important)
   - Bot-first support chat with full intent engine (payouts, trips, account, safety, etc.)
   - Fallback + escalation rules (manual & auto)
   - Conversation rating and “bot helpful / not helpful” tracking
   - Multi-role support: driver, rider, restaurant, parcel
   - Admin Live Support Console:
     - Route: /admin/support-chat
     - 2-panel layout: inbox + live chat
     - Filters: status (bot/open/pending/assigned/closed), userType
     - Assign → Reply → Close flow
     - Real-time polling
     - RBAC: SUPPORT_ADMIN only

Your job now:

STEP 1 – Full system scan and summary
1. Scan the entire codebase (backend + frontend).
2. List ALL major modules that are currently implemented and working, grouped by:
   - Driver
   - Rider
   - Restaurant
   - Courier
   - Admin
   - Shared systems (auth, database, payments, support, tax, points/tiers)
3. For each module, label status exactly as:
   - “Production-ready”
   - “Works but needs polish”
   - “Implemented but broken”
   - “Not implemented”
4. Output this as a clear RELEASE READINESS REPORT so a non-programmer can understand:
   - What is finished
   - What is partially done
   - What is still missing for a basic public launch

STEP 2 – Identify BLOCKERS for publishing
From that report, identify ONLY the true blocking issues for a first public MVP, such as:
   - Buttons that do nothing (Address Save, Add payout method, etc.)
   - Broken flows (wallet add/edit/delete not saving, support chat not escalating correctly, etc.)
   - Missing validations that can cause data corruption
   - Security issues (role checks missing, unsafe endpoints)
   - Routing issues (404s on important pages like /driver/support or /admin/support-chat)
   - Fatal errors in console / server logs

Create a short “BLOCKERS LIST” with:
   - Module
   - Problem
   - Root cause (short)
   - Fix plan (1–2 sentences)

STEP 3 – Fix BLOCKERS (without changing specs)
1. Systematically fix each blocker:
   - Payout methods: make sure bank + debit card + checking/savings all save, edit, and delete correctly per driver, with encryption.
   - Address page: Save button must update DB and show success state.
   - Support chat: 
     - Bot must use the full SafeGo Intent Engine prompt already provided.
     - Escalation to human must work (manual keyword + 3x not-helpful).
     - ConversationActive rules must be respected (no messages after closed).
   - Admin Live Support:
     - /admin/support-chat must open and show conversations.
     - Filters, assign, reply, end/close must work end-to-end.
2. Preserve all existing working behavior. Do NOT rename routes or API paths unless absolutely necessary. If you must change something, explain why in your summary.
3. Keep security tight:
   - All admin endpoints must require SUPPORT_ADMIN.
   - Users must only see their own data (wallet, payouts, documents, chats, etc.).
   - Sensitive info (SSN/NID) must be masked (show last 4 only).

STEP 4 – Final Publish Checklist
After fixes, output a final “READY TO PUBLISH” checklist including:
   - Frontend build status (no TypeScript/LSP errors, no console errors on main flows)
   - Backend status (server running cleanly, DB migrations applied)
   - Required environment variables and how they should be set for production
   - Any 3rd-party services mentioned (payments, email, SMS) and their current status
   - Basic monitoring/logging recommendations for production

Constraints:
- Do not refactor for style; focus on release stability and correctness.
- Do not remove any working feature (especially support chat, wallet, payouts, tax, points).
- Explain any major architectural change before applying it.
- All changes must be backward compatible with the current working flows.

Deliverables to me:
1) RELEASE READINESS REPORT (modules + status)
2) BLOCKERS LIST + what you fixed
3) Final “READY TO PUBLISH” checklist and any remaining non-blocking TODOs (nice-to-have only)

Start by scanning the system and producing the RELEASE READINESS REPORT, then proceed with fixes.
