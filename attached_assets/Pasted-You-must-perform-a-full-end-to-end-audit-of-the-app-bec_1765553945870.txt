You must perform a full end-to-end audit of the app because multiple routes are rendering a blank white screen
(e.g., /customer, /ride, /food, /parcel, /tickets, /shops).

Goal: eliminate white screen on every route and make published build stable.

STRICT REQUIREMENTS:
- Do not change product scope or remove features.
- Add safe fallbacks, loading states, and error boundaries so the UI never goes fully blank.
- Fix root causes (runtime errors, routing, API failures, env issues).
- Keep changes incremental and non-breaking.

STEP A — Reproduce and capture evidence
1) For each route:
   /, /customer, /ride, /food, /parcel, /tickets, /shops
   open it in Preview and in Published/Republish environment.
2) For each route, capture:
   - Browser console errors (stack traces)
   - Network tab: failed requests (status, URL, response body)
   - Server logs during the request
3) Summarize the root cause(s) for each route before applying fixes.

STEP B — Implement “Never Blank UI” safety net
4) Add a global React Error Boundary that catches render errors and shows a friendly error screen with:
   - route path
   - error message
   - retry button (reload)
5) Add Suspense/Loading fallback and route-level loading states.
6) Ensure every page component returns visible UI even if data fails (placeholder cards + message).

STEP C — Fix the actual root causes (most common)
7) If router configuration/base path is wrong:
   - confirm correct router setup for Replit publish
   - ensure all routes resolve to the app shell
8) If API calls fail:
   - verify API base URL is correct for preview and for published env
   - handle 401/403/500 gracefully
   - fix CORS if needed
9) If environment variables cause crashes:
   - validate all required envs at startup with clear logs
   - do not hard-crash the UI; show warning UI
10) Ensure build/start config is correct for production:
   - build: npm run build
   - start: npm run start
   - app must listen on process.env.PORT (not hardcoded)
   - no crash loop

STEP D — Verification checklist (must pass)
11) For each route listed in Step A:
   - page renders visible content (not blank)
   - no uncaught console errors
   - no infinite redirect loop
   - if data missing, user sees a clear empty-state UI
12) Provide me a short report:
   - What was broken (per route)
   - What you changed (files + key code)
   - Proof: screenshots of working pages + logs summary

Do not ask me questions. Do the audit, apply fixes, and deliver the working result.
