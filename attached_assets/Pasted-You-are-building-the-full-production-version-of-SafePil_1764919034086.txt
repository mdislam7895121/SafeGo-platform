You are building the full production version of **SafePilot**, the AI engine inside the SafeGo Admin Console.
Your goal is to make SafePilot the world’s strongest, most reliable, most intelligent safety–fraud–compliance assistant for a ride–delivery–parcel platform.

You must complete ALL tasks below WITHOUT asking any follow-up questions.  
Make reasonable assumptions and finish the implementation end-to-end.  
No TODOs. No placeholders. No partial steps.  
Make SafePilot fully functional and ready for public release.
