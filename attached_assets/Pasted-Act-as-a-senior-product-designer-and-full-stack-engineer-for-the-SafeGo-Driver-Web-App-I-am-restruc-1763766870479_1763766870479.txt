Act as a senior product designer and full-stack engineer for the SafeGo Driver Web App. I am restructuring the DRIVER SIDE navigation only. Do not change anything for Customer, Restaurant, or Admin flows except where explicitly mentioned.

Goal: Move Documents, Vehicles, Tax Info, Dark Mode, and Map Theme into a unified “Account Settings” area and rename Map Theme to “Map Settings” with support for Google Maps, Apple Maps, and Waze. Keep all existing APIs, data models, and security rules intact.

Follow all existing SafeGo conventions:
- Four roles: customer, driver, restaurant, admin (this task is DRIVER only)
- Keep all existing KYC, payouts, and onboarding logic unchanged
- Do not touch ride, food, or parcel booking flows
- Do not break any existing URLs or backend contracts

========================================
1) DRIVER SIDEBAR RESTRUCTURE
========================================

Current driver sidebar items (for reference):
- Dashboard
- Refer a Friend
- Opportunity
- SafeGo Points (or SafeGo Premium / SafeGo Points New)
- Wallet
- Documents
- Vehicles
- Tax Info
- Account Settings
- Map Theme
- Dark Mode
- Help Center
- Log Out

Update the sidebar so that it becomes:

- Dashboard
- Refer a Friend
- Opportunity
- SafeGo Points
- Wallet
- Account Settings
- Help Center
- Log Out

Rules:
- Remove these items from the top-level sidebar: Documents, Vehicles, Tax Info, Map Theme, Dark Mode
- Their functionality must not be deleted; they must be accessible from inside Account Settings
- All role-based access control stays exactly as before (driver only, authenticated, same guards)

========================================
2) ACCOUNT SETTINGS HUB (DRIVER)
========================================

Account Settings is now the central hub for all driver account-related configuration, similar to Uber’s account center. Keep the current “SafeGo Account” or “Account Settings” route but expand it with a sectioned layout.

Account Settings main page should show cards or a simple list for these sections:

- Personal Info
- Security
- Privacy & Data
- Documents
- Vehicles
- Tax Info
- Map Settings
- Appearance (Dark Mode)

Implementation details:
- Use the same minimalist card style we already use in the driver account center (white background, grey dividers, left-aligned content)
- Each row/card shows:
  - Title
  - Short description
  - “Manage” or right arrow to open the detailed page
- All existing pages for Personal Info, Security, Privacy & Data should remain exactly as they are and just be linked from here
- For Documents, Vehicles, Tax Info, Map Settings, and Appearance, reuse the existing routes where possible

Routing rules:
- Account Settings main route: /driver/account (or whatever is currently used; keep it the same)
- Documents: /driver/kyc-documents (reuse existing KYC Documents page)
- Vehicles: reuse existing driver vehicle management page, for example /driver/vehicles or /driver/vehicle
- Tax Info: reuse existing tax info page
- Map Settings: new page (see section 3)
- Appearance (Dark Mode): existing dark mode toggle, now surfaced as a setting under Account Settings

On the Account Settings landing page, clicking each row should navigate to the corresponding route. Do not break deep links that may already exist.

========================================
3) MAP THEME → MAP SETTINGS
========================================

We are renaming and expanding the current “Map Theme” feature into a more powerful “Map Settings” page.

Routing and naming:
- Create a new route: /driver/account/map-settings
- If /driver/account/map-theme currently exists, either:
  - Redirect it to /driver/account/map-settings, or
  - Make it an alias that renders the new Map Settings component
- In the UI everywhere, the label should be “Map Settings” (not “Map Theme”)

Map Settings page design:
- Page title: “Map Settings”
- Subtitle: “Choose your preferred navigation app and map display.”
- Section 1: Navigation App
  - Radio group or segmented control with options:
    - Default SafeGo Map
    - Google Maps
    - Apple Maps
    - Waze
  - Only show Apple Maps if the platform or region supports it (follow any existing platform checks we already use)
  - Store the selected navigation app in the driver’s profile or existing preferences store so that other parts of the app can read it later
- Section 2: Map Style (optional, reuse existing Map Theme if available)
  - Keep the existing Standard / Satellite / Terrain style if it already exists
  - These styles should still work with the Default SafeGo Map
- Add a Save button (if needed) or auto-save on selection, following our existing UX pattern

Security and data rules:
- Only authenticated drivers can view or change Map Settings
- Do not expose internal identifiers
- Respect existing localization and i18n; keep labels easy to translate

========================================
4) DOCUMENTS, VEHICLES, TAX INFO UNDER ACCOUNT SETTINGS
========================================

Documents:
- Use the existing KYC Documents page and logic
- Access path from Account Settings:
  - Account Settings → Documents → existing KYC screen
- Keep all existing document upload rules (profile photo, driver license, DMV/TLC, registration, insurance)

Vehicles:
- Use the existing vehicle management UI (vehicle list + add/edit)
- Access path from Account Settings:
  - Account Settings → Vehicles → existing vehicle management screen
- Do not modify vehicle registration logic, document requirements, or backend APIs

Tax Info:
- Use the existing tax info UI and route
- Access path from Account Settings:
  - Account Settings → Tax Info
- Leave all tax logic and country-specific requirements unchanged

Dark Mode (Appearance):
- Remove Dark Mode from driver sidebar
- Create an “Appearance” or “Display” row inside Account Settings
  - When opened, show the existing Dark Mode toggle and any future display settings
- Keep the current dark mode implementation (theme provider, local storage, etc.) exactly as is; only move the entry point

========================================
5) UX AND TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
========================================

- Do not touch ride booking, job lists, or earnings flows; this task only restructures navigation and account-level settings
- Keep all existing security phases and SafeGo security roadmap practices:
  - Auth checks and RBAC must remain in place
  - No debug data or sensitive identifiers in the UI
- Keep all tests passing; update or add tests for:
  - Sidebar items for driver role
  - Account Settings navigation links
  - Map Settings route and default options
- Ensure mobile responsiveness stays correct for the new Account Settings layout
- Make sure there are no 404 pages for any previous links:
  - If a previous menu item pointed directly to Documents or Vehicles, those routes must still exist and be reachable
  - Only the sidebar entry point changes; underlying routes remain valid or redirect

========================================
6) DELIVERABLES
========================================

1) Updated driver sidebar implementation reflecting the new menu:
   Dashboard, Refer a Friend, Opportunity, SafeGo Points, Wallet, Account Settings, Help Center, Log Out.

2) An Account Settings hub page that lists:
   Personal Info, Security, Privacy & Data, Documents, Vehicles, Tax Info, Map Settings, Appearance (Dark Mode), each linking to the correct existing or new route.

3) A fully working Map Settings page at /driver/account/map-settings with:
   - Navigation app selection: Default SafeGo Map, Google Maps, Apple Maps, Waze
   - Optional map style controls reusing current map theme logic
   - Correct persistence in driver settings

4) All navigation paths verified so that no 404 errors appear for:
   - Documents
   - Vehicles
   - Tax Info
   - Map Settings
   - Dark Mode/Appearance

Please implement these changes now, following SafeGo’s existing component library and coding standards, and keep everything backward compatible.
