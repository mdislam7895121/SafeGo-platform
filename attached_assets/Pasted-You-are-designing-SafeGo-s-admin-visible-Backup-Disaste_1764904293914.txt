You are designing SafeGo’s admin-visible **Backup & Disaster Recovery** controls.

Respect all SafeGo security rules:
- Never expose raw database credentials or cloud secrets in the UI.
- Only SUPER_ADMIN and a dedicated `INFRA_ADMIN` role may trigger backup/restore actions.
- All actions must be auditable and, where possible, require human confirmation.

TASK GOAL  
Expose a safe, minimal **Backup & DR** section in the admin console that integrates with existing backup mechanisms (real or mocked), so business stakeholders can see that backups exist and infra admins can trigger controlled operations.

REQUIREMENTS  

1. Backup Metadata Model
   - Define a `BackupSnapshot` entity with fields:
     - id
     - createdAt
     - environment (dev/staging/prod)
     - type (FULL_DB, PARTIAL_ANALYTICS, FILES_ONLY, CONFIG_ONLY)
     - storageLocationLabel (friendly name only, no raw bucket URLs/keys)
     - sizeMb (approx)
     - status (CREATED, VERIFIED, FAILED)
   - Provide an API for listing and viewing details.

2. Integration with Real Backup Jobs
   - If actual backup jobs exist, hook into their completion to create `BackupSnapshot` entries.
   - If not, simulate via a command/function you can call from code, clearly marked as a stub so it can be wired later.

3. Admin Actions
   - On the “Backups” page, allow:
     - Trigger new backup (for permitted environments only).
     - Mark a snapshot as “Verified” after a test restore.
   - On a separate “Restore” tab:
     - Show a big warning banner that restore is dangerous and usually done outside production UI.
     - Allow only **staged restore** to a non-prod environment (e.g. restore prod backup into a staging DB alias) – do not implement destructive production restores.
   - Every action must:
     - Require confirmation (type the snapshot ID or environment name).
     - Write a detailed audit log entry.

4. Disaster Recovery Checklist & Status
   - Add a non-interactive DR status section summarizing:
     - RPO/RTO targets (text).
     - When last backup was taken & verified.
     - Whether cross-region backup copies exist (boolean flags).
   - This is mostly content + data read from `BackupSnapshot`.

5. UI/UX
   - New sidebar entry: “Infrastructure” → “Backups & DR”.
   - Clear separation:
     - Snapshots list + filters (by environment, type, status).
     - Actions (Trigger backup, Verify backup).
     - DR Overview section.

6. Safety & Guardrails
   - Ensure all sensitive configuration remains server-side only.
   - Any failure talking to the backup system should be reported gracefully in the UI without exposing stack traces or secret values.

Deliver a concrete implementation: schema/models, routes, and admin UI that is production-safe even if underlying backup wiring is initially partial/mock.
