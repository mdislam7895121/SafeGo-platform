SAFEGO — REPLIT AGENT PROMPT (LAYOUT FIX ONLY)

Context
- Project: SafeGo customer app (web/landing ride flow)
- Environment: Replit workspace
- Issue: The map renders as a tiny square in the center instead of filling the screen.
- Backend/APIs are OK. This is a pure frontend layout sizing bug.

Hard rules (non-breaking)
1) Do NOT change any backend code, endpoints, pricing logic, status logic, or schemas.
2) Do NOT rename routes or files.
3) Only edit layout/CSS/containers related to the map screen.
4) Keep all existing UI behaviors (button, bottom panel, header).
5) Fix must be backward-compatible.

What you must do (step-by-step)
1) Find the exact file(s) that render the Ride screen map (search for keywords: "Map", "map", "leaflet", "mapbox", "google", "MapView", "Request SafeGo", "ride").
2) Identify the map container element (the parent div/view wrapping the Map component).
3) Audit the entire parent chain: screen root → layout wrapper → content area → map wrapper → map component.
4) Fix the sizing using a strict “full-height chain” approach:

   A) Ensure the page root has height:
      - html, body, and the app root container must be height: 100% (or min-height: 100vh)
      - eliminate any parent wrappers that have no height

   B) Ensure the map wrapper fills available space:
      - map wrapper must be width: 100%
      - map wrapper must have flex: 1 (or height: 100% if parent has explicit height)
      - map canvas element must also be set to width/height 100%

   C) If there is a bottom panel / request button overlay:
      - keep it positioned (fixed/absolute) above the map
      - do NOT let it reduce map height or collapse the map container
      - add padding-bottom to the map wrapper only if needed to prevent overlay hiding map controls

5) Remove/replace common breakage patterns:
   - height: "100%" on elements whose parents don’t have height
   - fixed pixel heights that cause center square map
   - map wrapper inside a container without display:flex or without height

Debug requirement (must do)
- Temporarily add a visible background to the map wrapper to confirm it fills the screen.
- Confirm in preview that the wrapper expands full height, then remove debug background.

Deliverables
1) Provide the exact files changed (with paths).
2) Provide a minimal diff-style patch (before/after or code blocks).
3) Explain the root cause in 2–3 lines (container height/flex chain).
4) Confirm the verification checklist below.

Verification checklist (must pass)
- Map fills the available screen area (no tiny center square).
- Header stays at top, request button stays visible.
- No horizontal/vertical unexpected scroll added.
- Layout works in Replit preview window and mobile-sized responsive view.
- No backend or route changes.

STOP conditions
- If you can’t find the map file, list the 3 most likely candidate files with paths and the search terms used, then stop.
- Do NOT refactor the project structure.
