You are working on the SafeGo-platform Admin Console. Current problem: Admin sidebar items and many admin “cards” navigate to routes that show “404 Page Not Found” (examples seen: /admin/security-center, /admin/parcels, /admin/parcels?status=delivered, /admin/cms-pages sometimes, /admin/bd-expansion, and other admin pages). Also there is a “duplicate admin”/duplicate layout behavior (a second admin view appears), and the left sidebar scroll jumps upward / feels broken. The previous agent claimed “45+ routes added” and “AdminNotFound fallback,” but in reality navigation still lands on 404 for many items. I need you to audit the entire Admin area end-to-end and fix routing + layout so every visible admin navigation target resolves to a real page.

Hard requirements
1) Do NOT add any new “second admin” or duplicate admin layout. There must be exactly one admin shell/layout.
2) Every admin navigation item and every admin dashboard card click must route to a valid page (no 404). If a feature is not implemented yet, the route must still exist and show a clean “Coming soon” page inside the admin layout.
3) Fix sidebar scroll behavior: sidebar must be independently scrollable and not jump; header stays stable; content scrolls properly.
4) Fix navigation to always use absolute /admin/... paths (no relative path bugs).
5) Keep changes incremental and non-breaking. Do not refactor unrelated areas.
6) Add a verification method: a lightweight script/test or an internal “Routes Health” page that lists admin routes and highlights missing ones.

What to do (step-by-step)
A) Inventory routes
- Locate the Admin sidebar configuration and Admin dashboard cards configuration (where the click targets are defined).
- Extract every route path currently used (strings like /admin/xyz, /admin/parcels, /admin/cms-pages, etc.). Include hidden/secondary routes (filters like parcels?status=delivered).
- Create a single source of truth file for admin routes (e.g., src/admin/adminRoutes.ts) exporting:
  - route constants (path strings)
  - sidebar items (label, icon, path)
  - dashboard cards (label, path)
  - a flat array ALL_ADMIN_ROUTES for validation

B) Fix routing so all routes exist
- Find how routing is implemented (Next.js pages router, Next.js app router, React Router, or custom).
- Ensure there is exactly ONE admin layout/shell component used by all /admin routes (no duplicate wrapper).
- For each route in ALL_ADMIN_ROUTES:
  - If a real page already exists, confirm it is connected and reachable.
  - If missing, create a page component/file for that route that renders:
    - AdminLayout (the single shell)
    - A standardized placeholder view: title, short description, “Coming soon”, and optional link back to /admin
- Ensure /admin/cms-pages resolves to the intended CMS Pages screen (not AdminNotFound).
- Ensure query routes like /admin/parcels?status=delivered still load the /admin/parcels page and interpret query safely.

C) Fix the “duplicate admin” issue
- Identify why a second admin page/layout appears:
  - duplicated route registration
  - nested router mounting admin inside admin
  - wrong layout nesting
  - rendering AdminLayout twice (one in route wrapper + one in page)
- Remove the duplication so each admin route renders AdminLayout exactly once.
- Confirm the main /admin dashboard renders normally and other pages keep the same shell.

D) Fix sidebar scroll + layout stability
- Admin shell layout rules:
  - Left sidebar: fixed width, height: 100vh (or full container), overflow-y: auto
  - Header/top bar: sticky within main content area (or fixed) without causing scroll reset
  - Main content: overflow-y: auto with stable scroll container
- Ensure clicking sidebar items does not reset sidebar scroll position unexpectedly.
- Ensure the sidebar doesn’t “jump up” after navigation. Use stable keys and avoid re-mounting the sidebar on route change.

E) Fix navigation calls
- Replace any router.push("cms-pages") relative navigation with router.push("/admin/cms-pages") absolute.
- If there’s a helper navigateToAdminRoute(), use it everywhere.
- Ensure dashboard cards use the same route constants (no inline strings).

F) CMS Pages “Failed to load pages” robustness
- After route exists, if CMS Pages loads but shows “Failed to load pages”:
  - Confirm API endpoint is correct
  - Confirm auth/role is required; if not logged in, show a clean “Authentication required” state inside the page, not a crash.
  - Add error boundary / graceful empty state so it never breaks the entire admin UI.

G) Add verification
Option 1 (preferred): Add /admin/routes-health page:
- Lists ALL_ADMIN_ROUTES
- For each route, a “Check” button that fetches it (client-side HEAD/GET) and shows OK/Not Found.
Option 2: Add a small dev script that logs missing route files/registrations.

Deliverables
1) All admin sidebar items and admin dashboard cards navigate to real pages (no 404).
2) No duplicate admin layout. Only one admin shell.
3) Sidebar scroll is stable and independently scrollable; does not jump.
4) A centralized adminRoutes.ts (or similar) used across sidebar + cards + route health.
5) A brief written checklist showing:
   - total routes found
   - which were missing and added as placeholders
   - which were mapped to real pages
   - how to verify using /admin/routes-health

How to validate (you must do this)
- Click every sidebar item one by one and confirm:
  - URL changes to /admin/...
  - Page renders inside AdminLayout
  - No 404 screen appears
- Click every admin dashboard card (and any “quick action” card) and confirm the same.
- Scroll sidebar down, click an item, confirm sidebar scroll stays where it was (no jump to top).
- Refresh on a deep link like /admin/security-center and confirm it loads (no 404).

Important
Do not “solve” by showing AdminNotFound for real routes. Real routes must exist. If a route is not ready, show ComingSoonPage but still render within AdminLayout. The goal is a fully navigable admin panel with zero dead links.
