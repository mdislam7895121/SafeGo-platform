Implement real road routes with traffic-based alternatives for the customer ride planner.

Context:
- SafeGo web app uses an OpenStreetMap/Leaflet map and Google Places Autocomplete.
- Currently the map shows a straight dashed line between pickup and dropoff, and a simple “Heavy traffic expected” badge.
- We want actual driving routes along real roads, traffic-aware ETA, and multiple route options so the rider can choose.

Tasks:

1. Backend: Create a directions endpoint using Google Directions API
   - File targets (adjust to actual structure):
     - server/routes/maps.ts (or similar)
   - Add GET /api/maps/route that accepts:
     - origin: "lat,lng"
     - destination: "lat,lng"
   - Inside the handler, call:
     - https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json
     - Parameters:
       - mode=driving
       - alternatives=true
       - departure_time=now
       - traffic_model=best_guess
       - key=process.env.GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY
   - If status != "OK", return JSON:
     `{ success: false, message: data.status }`
   - If OK, map the response to a clean JSON shape:
     ```ts
     {
       success: true,
       routes: data.routes.map((r, index) => ({
         id: index,
         summary: r.summary,
         polyline: r.overview_polyline.points,
         distanceMeters: r.legs[0].distance.value,
         durationSeconds: r.legs[0].duration.value,
         durationInTrafficSeconds: r.legs[0].duration_in_traffic?.value ?? r.legs[0].duration.value
       }))
     }
     ```
   - Keep Google API key usage secure; do not log the key.

2. Frontend: use the new endpoint on the customer ride planning screen
   - Likely file:
     - client/src/pages/customer/RidePlanPage.tsx
     - or client/src/components/ride/RidePlanner.tsx
   - When both pickup and dropoff are selected (with lat/lng), call:
     GET /api/maps/route?origin=lat,lng&destination=lat,lng
   - Store the returned `routes` array in component state:
     - `routes`
     - `activeRouteId`
   - Draw polylines on the existing Leaflet map:
     - Decode the polyline string into coordinates.
     - Render all routes, but highlight the active route with higher weight/opacity.

3. Traffic labels and ETA formatting
   - For each route, compute:
     - `etaMinutes = Math.round(durationInTrafficSeconds / 60)`
     - Display as `~X h Y min` instead of pure minutes.
   - Compute traffic level:
     ```ts
     const ratio = durationInTrafficSeconds / durationSeconds;
     let trafficLevel: "light" | "moderate" | "heavy";
     if (ratio < 1.1) trafficLevel = "light";
     else if (ratio < 1.3) trafficLevel = "moderate";
     else trafficLevel = "heavy";
     ```
   - Show a badge under the Estimated fare card:
     - Light → “Light traffic on this route”
     - Moderate → “Some traffic expected”
     - Heavy → “Heavy traffic expected”

4. Fare calculation must use traffic time
   - Wherever we calculate price today, switch to using `durationInTrafficSeconds` instead of plain distance-only time.
   - Keep the existing base fare and per-km/per-minute logic, just pass the new duration.
   - Ensure changing the active route updates:
     - the highlighted polyline
     - the ETA
     - the fare

5. Route selection UI
   - Under the Estimated fare card, show small buttons or tabs for each route:
     - e.g. “Route 1 – Fastest”, “Route 2 – Less traffic”, “Route 3 – Shortest”.
   - When the user taps a route:
     - set `activeRouteId`
     - update the map highlight and fare
   - Default to the fastest route.

6. Safety and non-breaking changes
   - Do not break existing Google Places autocomplete, current location, or ride request flow.
   - If the directions endpoint fails, gracefully fall back to the existing simple straight line and show a warning banner instead of crashing.

After implementing, reload the /customer/ride screen, plan a ride from “188 Sutter Ave, Brooklyn, NY” to “Connecticut, USA”, and verify:
   - The map shows a realistic road route instead of a straight line.
   - ETA uses hours + minutes (e.g., `~7 h 4 min`).
   - Traffic badge reflects the traffic level.
   - Multiple routes are selectable and change price + ETA.
