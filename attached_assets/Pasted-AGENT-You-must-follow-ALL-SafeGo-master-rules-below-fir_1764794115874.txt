AGENT:  
You must follow ALL SafeGo master rules below **first**, then implement the country-specific Partner Card tagline system for Bangladesh and USA exactly as described.

==================================================
A) SAFEGO MASTER RULES (MUST ALWAYS APPLY)
==================================================

1) ROLES (4 distinct roles — never mixed):
   - Customer
   - Driver
   - Restaurant (Merchant)
   - Admin
   Each role must have:
     • its own onboarding
     • its own KYC (BD vs US)
     • its own dashboard
     • its own permissions
     • its own status flows

2) GLOBAL SERVICES (3 core services):
   - Ride-hailing
   - Food delivery
   - Parcel delivery
   These must always be supported.

3) COUNTRY-SPECIFIC KYC (MANDATORY BRANCHING):

   BANGLADESH (BD):
     - father_name
     - date_of_birth
     - present_address
     - permanent_address
     - NID_number
     - NID_front_image
     - NID_back_image
     - emergency_contact_name
     - emergency_contact_phone
     - verification_status
     - is_verified

   UNITED STATES (US):
     - date_of_birth
     - home_address
     - emergency_contact_name
     - emergency_contact_phone
     - government_id_type
     - government_id_last4
     - (drivers) driver_license_number + image + expiry
     - (drivers) ssn_last4 (optional)
     - verification_status
     - is_verified

4) ADMIN PANEL (must never break):
   - verify customers/drivers/restaurants
   - approve/reject KYC + rejection_reason
   - update pricing, fees, commissions
   - block/unblock
   - manage payouts
   - view negative balances

5) MANDATORY COLLECTIONS:
   - rides
   - food_orders
   - deliveries
   Each must contain:
     • identity fields (customer_id, driver_id, restaurant_id)
     • addresses + geolocation
     • fees + commission
     • payment details
     • timestamps
     • complete status flow
     • rating & feedback

6) COMMISSION RULES:
   - CASH ride → driver keeps cash; commission becomes driver negative balance
   - CASH food → restaurant keeps cash; commission becomes negative restaurant balance
   - ONLINE → SafeGo keeps commission automatically
   - Admin settles balances

7) SECURITY RULES:
   - customer cannot view driver documents
   - driver cannot view customer ID docs
   - restaurants cannot view each other
   - only Admin can approve KYC, change pricing/commission, block/unblock
   - users can update only their own profile

8) STATUS FLOWS (never remove):
   RIDE:
     requested → searching_driver → accepted → driver_arriving → in_progress → completed
   FOOD:
     placed → accepted → preparing → ready_for_pickup → picked_up → on_the_way → delivered
   PARCEL:
     requested → searching_driver → accepted → picked_up → on_the_way → delivered

9) ONBOARDING RULES:
   Customer signup only creates customer accounts.
   Drivers & restaurants created **after login** via separate onboarding flows.

10) NOTIFICATIONS:
   - ride alerts, order updates, delivery updates
   - verification approval/rejection
   - admin important notifications

==================================================
B) TASK — IMPLEMENT COUNTRY-SPECIFIC PARTNER CARD TEXTS
==================================================

You must configure Partner Cards to show different taglines based on country_code ("BD" or "US").

------------------------------------------
1) BANGLADESH (BD) — 5 Partner Cards
------------------------------------------

MASTER TAGLINE (top of section, BD):
  “আপনার সময়কে আয়ে পরিণত করুন। SafeGo–তে পার্টনার হোন।”

BD PARTNER CARDS (short & powerful):

1) Ride Share Driver
   “নিজের মতো চালান, প্রতিদিন আয় করুন।”

2) Delivery Driver (Food + Parcel)
   “ডেলিভারি দিন, আয় বাড়ান।”

3) Restaurant Partner
   “নতুন গ্রাহক পান, অর্ডার বাড়ান।”

4) Tickets Partner
   “টিকিট অনলাইনে দিন, বিক্রি বাড়ান।”

5) Shop Partner
   “দোকান অনলাইনে আনুন, বেশি ক্রেতা পান।”


------------------------------------------
2) UNITED STATES (US) — 3 Partner Cards
------------------------------------------

MASTER TAGLINE (top of section, US):
  “Turn your time into income. Become a SafeGo Partner.”

USA PARTNER CARDS (short & powerful):

1) Ride Share Driver
   “Drive your way. Earn every day.”

2) Food & Parcel Delivery Driver
   “Deliver more. Earn more.”

3) Restaurant Partner
   “Reach more customers. Grow your orders.”


==================================================
C) IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS
==================================================

1) Add a country-aware text module:
   getPartnerCardText(country_code, partner_type)

2) If country_code == "BD":
      load 5 Bangla texts
   If country_code == "US":
      load 3 English texts
   If another country:
      default to English fallback

3) USA MUST NOT show:
   - Shop Partner
   - Tickets Partner

4) BD MUST show all 5 cards.

5) Do NOT remove or break any existing logic.
   Only ADD:
     - text config
