====================================
THIS TASK (FRONTEND ONLY): ALIGN LEFT & RIGHT FOOTER BUTTONS SYMMETRICALLY
====================================

Screen: /driver/map  (SafeGo driver map screen)

We are focusing ONLY on the three floating footer controls that sit on top of the map:

1) Center pill button:
   - “Go Online / Go Offline”
   - Already centered at the bottom of the map.
2) Left circular FAB (bottom-left):
   - Trip selector (current screenshot: grid icon).
3) Right circular FAB (bottom-right):
   - Trip menu / current trip (three horizontal lines).

THE GOAL:
- The left and right circular buttons must be **perfect mirror positions**:
  - Same bottom distance from the edge.
  - Same horizontal margin (left vs right).
  - Same size, shape, and vertical alignment.
- Center pill remains perfectly centered.
- No backend or business logic changes.

------------------------------------
A) DEFINE THE MAP CONTAINER AS POSITION CONTEXT
------------------------------------
1. Locate the main map wrapper in client/src/pages/driver/map.tsx (or equivalent).
   This is the container that holds:
   - the map component
   - the center Go Online button
   - the left and right footer FABs.

2. Ensure this wrapper has:
   - `position: relative;`
   This makes it the positioning context for the footer buttons.

   Example (JSX with Tailwind-style classes):

   ```tsx
   <div className="driver-map-container relative w-full h-full">
     {/* map + floating buttons live here */}
   </div>
