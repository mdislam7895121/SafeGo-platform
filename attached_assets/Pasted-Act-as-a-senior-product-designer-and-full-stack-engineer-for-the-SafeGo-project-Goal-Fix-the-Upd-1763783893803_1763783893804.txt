Act as a senior product designer and full-stack engineer for the SafeGo project.

Goal: Fix the "Update Tax Information" button behavior on the driver Tax Info page so that it opens the correct tax update flow, following all existing SafeGo conventions.

Context:
- Current route: /driver/account/tax-info
- The page shows:
  - "Tax Documents" section (Download 2024 Tax Summary, 2023 1099-K)
  - "Taxpayer Information" section (Tax ID Status, W-9 Form)
  - Primary button: "Update Tax Information"
- The button visually appears but does nothing when tapped (no navigation, no modal, no API call).
- SafeGo uses four roles: customer, driver, restaurant, admin. This feature is only for the driver web app, inside Account Settings.
- Do not add any emojis in the UI or text.
- Do not touch ride, food, parcel, or payout logic.
- Do not break any existing URLs or layouts.

Requirements:

1) Button behavior
- Make the "Update Tax Information" button fully functional.
- When the driver clicks/taps it, open the tax update flow using one of these patterns (choose the one that best matches the existing SafeGo account architecture):
  a) Navigate to a dedicated edit page: /driver/account/tax-info/edit
  OR
  b) Open a tax update modal/panel on the same page with a form.

2) Tax update form (UI and behavior)
If you choose a dedicated edit page or modal, include these fields:

- Country (read-only, taken from driver profile)
- Full legal name (pre-filled, editable)
- Tax ID / SSN / NID (masked input)
- Tax classification (e.g., Individual, Sole proprietor)
- Address (Street, City, State/Region, Postal code)
- W-9 or local equivalent status (checkbox or selector)

Form rules:
- Mask the tax ID value on screen (show only last 4 digits when editing existing data).
- New entries can be typed fully, but after save the value should display as masked (e.g., ***-**-1234).
- Client-side validation: required fields cannot be empty, show inline error messages.
- Include primary button "Save Tax Information" and secondary "Cancel" that returns to /driver/account/tax-info without saving.

3) Security and authorization
- Ensure only the authenticated driver can see and edit their own tax info.
- Do not allow any way to access another driver’s tax data by changing IDs in the URL.
- Keep all tax data behind existing authentication and follow SafeGo security conventions.
- Do not log full tax IDs in the console or analytics; log only masked values if needed.

4) Integration with existing page
- After a successful save:
  - Redirect back to /driver/account/tax-info.
  - Refresh the "Tax ID Status" and "W-9 Form" labels if they are driven by backend data.
  - Show a lightweight success state (e.g., inline confirmation text) that matches existing SafeGo account styling.
- Make sure the "Update Tax Information" button now triggers the new flow both on desktop and mobile.

5) Technical notes
- Reuse existing SafeGo account layout components and typography.
- Keep the Tax Info page structure and download buttons unchanged.
- Do not introduce any breaking changes to routing or API contracts that other features depend on.

When you are done, summarize:
- What routing or modal changes you made for the button.
- What validations and masking rules you implemented.
- Any backend/API updates you added or reused.
