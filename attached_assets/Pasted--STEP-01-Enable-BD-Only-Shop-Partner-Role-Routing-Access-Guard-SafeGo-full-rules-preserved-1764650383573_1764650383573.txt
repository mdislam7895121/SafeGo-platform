# STEP 01 — Enable BD-Only Shop Partner Role + Routing + Access Guard
# (SafeGo full rules preserved, non-breaking, Bangladesh-only feature flag)

You must activate the Bangladesh-only Shop Partner role in the SafeGo system
WITHOUT modifying any existing roles or backend flows.

===================================================
A) ROLE ACTIVATION (BD ONLY)
===================================================
1. Add “Shop Partner” as a selectable role ONLY for Bangladesh users.
2. Do NOT show this role anywhere for US users.
3. Use existing country detection logic:
   if user.country == "BD": show Shop Partner role
   else: hide completely.

4. Shop Partner must follow the SAME onboarding stages required by SafeGo rules:
   - Basic info
   - Address
   - BD KYC requirements (father_name, DOB, present_address,
     permanent_address, NID number + front/back, emergency contact)
   - verification_status = "pending"
   - is_verified = false

5. Do NOT modify or break Customer, Driver, Restaurant, Admin flows.

===================================================
B) ROLE-BASED ROUTING (MANDATORY)
===================================================
After login:
- If BD user role == Shop Partner:
  redirect to:  /shop-partner/dashboard

- Add a route guard:
  Only verified Shop Partners OR pending Shop Partners accessing setup wizard
  may see pages inside /shop-partner/*

- US users or any non-Shop-Partner must be fully blocked from these routes.

===================================================
C) CREATE SHOP PARTNER DASHBOARD SHELL (EMPTY FOR NOW)
===================================================
Create the frontend shell structure for Shop Partner:

Routes:
- /shop-partner/dashboard
- /shop-partner/setup
- /shop-partner/products
- /shop-partner/orders
- /shop-partner/wallet
- /shop-partner/profile

These pages can be empty shells for now, but MUST exist with clean routing.

===================================================
D) BANGLA LANGUAGE FRAMEWORK
===================================================
Enable a Bangla UI mode ONLY for Shop Partner screens.

Rules:
- Every Shop Partner page must use Bangla text by default.
- Implement a simple localization wrapper:
  t_bn("দোকান সেটআপ"), t_bn("পণ্য যোগ করুন"), etc.

Content will be added later; for now just activate the Bangla language mode.

===================================================
E) SECURITY & ISOLATION
===================================================
- Shop Partners cannot access Customer, Driver, Restaurant or Admin dashboards.
- No other role may access /shop-partner/* routes.
- Must follow SafeGo security rules.

===================================================
F) DO NOT CHANGE ANY EXISTING BACKEND API
===================================================
You may only add frontend routing + role guard.

===================================================
