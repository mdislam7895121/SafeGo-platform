PHASE 2 – SafeGo Eats Restaurant Live Orders Panel (LEFT COLUMN ONLY)

GOAL:
Implement the Live Orders experience in the left column of the Restaurant Dashboard without breaking any backend contracts.

SCOPE:
- Only affects restaurant dashboard left column and any LiveOrders components.
- Use existing order and status models from the backend.
- No schema changes.

REQUIREMENTS:

1) LIVE ORDERS LIST
- Fetch current orders for this restaurant with a non-terminal status.
- Each order card must show:
  - Order ID
  - Time received (“10 min ago” style if possible)
  - Short item summary (e.g., “3 items · 2x Burger, 1x Fries”)
  - Order type: Delivery / Pickup
  - Payment status (Paid / Pending)
  - Status badge: NEW, ACCEPTED, PREPARING, READY, OUT FOR DELIVERY, COMPLETED

2) STATUS TRANSITIONS (RESTAURANT SIDE)
- For each status, allowed actions:
  - NEW:
    - Button: Accept
    - Button: Reject (requires confirmation)
  - ACCEPTED:
    - Button: Mark as Preparing
  - PREPARING:
    - Button: Mark as Ready
  - READY:
    - Button: Mark as Out for Delivery (only for delivery orders)
    - For pickup orders: Button: “Customer Picked Up” → Completed
- Use existing APIs for updating order status.
- If API errors, show toast with clear message and do NOT crash list.

3) EMPTY / LOADING STATES
- Loading: skeleton cards or simple “Loading live orders…” message.
- Empty: “No live orders right now. New orders will appear here as customers order.”

4) PERFORMANCE
- Use polling or existing mechanisms already used elsewhere (DO NOT introduce WebSocket here if system doesn’t have it).
- Polling interval must be reasonable (e.g., 10–15 seconds) and reuse global config if one exists.

5) NON-BREAKING & SECURITY
- Reuse existing order types/enums.
- Do not introduce new status values.
- Ensure restaurant cannot update orders belonging to other restaurants (respect existing RBAC/filters).

DELIVERABLE:
- Left column updated with a working Live Orders list.
- Short summary of new components and which APIs are called.
