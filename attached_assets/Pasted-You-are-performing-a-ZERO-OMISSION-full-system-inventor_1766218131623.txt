You are performing a ZERO-OMISSION full system inventory audit of the SafeGo platform.

This is NOT a summary.
This is NOT a high-level overview.

Your task is to list EVERYTHING that exists in the codebase,
from the first file to the last file,
with exact names.
No assumptions.
No grouping without listing items.
No skipping.

If something exists in code, config, database, UI, or automation,
it MUST appear in this report.
