Upgrade the Restaurant Menu Item categories to a two-level system: Main Category + Subcategory.

Goal:
Make it easy for restaurant owners to select a primary food category first, then choose one or more subcategories from a predefined library, while still allowing custom entries. Preserve all existing SafeGo rules and avoid breaking existing data.

Scope:
- Pages:
  - /restaurant/menu
  - /restaurant/menu/add (or the modal used by “Add First Item” and normal “Add Item”)
- Affects:
  - Menu item creation and edit flows
  - Menu item data model (categories)

A. Data Model

1. Introduce a two-level category structure in the menu item model:
   - primaryCategory: string (required)
   - subCategories: string[] (optional, but recommended)

2. Backwards compatibility:
   - If existing items currently use `category` or `categories: string[]`:
     - Map them as follows:
       - If `primaryCategory` is empty and `category` exists → set `primaryCategory = category`.
       - If `primaryCategory` is empty and `categories` exists → set:
         - `primaryCategory = categories[0]`
         - `subCategories = categories.slice(1)`
   - Keep old fields only if needed for migration, but the new UI should read/write using:
     - `primaryCategory`
     - `subCategories`

3. API update:
   - Ensure create/update/get menu item endpoints send and return:
     - primaryCategory: string
     - subCategories: string[]
   - Do not change other request/response fields.
   - Ensure all existing menu operations remain functional.

B. Category Library (Config-Driven)

1. Create a central config file (for example `menuCategoryConfig.ts`) that exports a nested structure:

   - Example structure:
     - Burgers
       - Beef Burger
       - Chicken Burger

2. This library must be:
   - Easy to extend later.
   - Not hard-coded deep inside components.
   - Used as the single source of truth for category/subcategory dropdowns.

C. UI/UX – Menu Item Form

1. Replace the existing category input with two fields:
   - Field 1: Main Category (required)
     - Single-select dropdown.
     - Options = keys from the category config (B1).
     - With search-as-you-type on mobile and desktop.
   - Field 2: Subcategory (optional multi-select)
     - Multi-select checkbox dropdown.
     - Options depend on the selected Main Category.
     - When Main Category changes, reset Subcategory selections.

2. Interaction details:
   - When user selects Main Category:
     - Load corresponding subcategory list from the config.
   - Subcategory selector:
     - Multi-select with checkboxes.
     - Selected subcategories shown as chips/pills.
     - Allow clearing one chip at a time.

3. Custom entries:
   - For Main Category:
     - Show an option at the bottom: “Create new main category: <typed text>”.
     - If selected, save as `primaryCategory` even if not in config.
   - For Subcategory:
     - Show an option: “Create new subcategory: <typed text>”.
     - Append to `subCategories` for that item only (do NOT modify the global config).
   - Custom entries must look visually distinct (e.g., tagged as “Custom” in UX if you choose, but not required by me).

4. Validation rules:
   - primaryCategory is required.
   - At least one subcategory is recommended, but not strictly required:
     - If no subcategory selected, show a gentle warning (non-blocking).
   - Error message examples:
     - “Please select a main category.”
   - Keep all existing field validations (name, price, description, etc.) unchanged.

D. Responsiveness & Accessibility

1. Make sure both dropdowns work properly on:
   - Mobile (320px+)
   - Tablet (768px+)
   - Desktop (1024px+)

2. Requirements:
   - No horizontal scrolling.
   - Dropdowns should be keyboard-accessible.
   - Chips should wrap on multiple lines instead of overflowing.

E. Regression & Testing

1. Backwards compatibility:
   - Verify existing menu items still render correctly on /restaurant/menu.
   - Editing an old item should pre-fill:
     - Main Category: mapped from previous `category` or first element of `categories`.
     - Subcategories: mapped from remaining elements (if `categories` existed).

2. New workflows to test:
   - Create a new item using only predefined main + subcategories.
   - Create a new item with:
     - Predefined main category.
     - Custom subcategory.
   - Create a new item with:
     - Custom main category.
     - Custom subcategory.
   - Edit an existing item and change:
     - Only subcategories.
     - Both main and subcategories.

3. Confirm that:
   - Data is saved correctly to the database.
   - All menu lists, filters, and any category-based displays still work or degrade gracefully.

After implementation:
- Run the app and test on /restaurant/menu:
  - Click “Add First Item” and verify:
    - Main Category dropdown appears and loads the config categories.
    - Subcategory dropdown updates based on selected main category.
    - Custom categories/subcategories can be added.
    - Item saves successfully and reloads with correct main + subcategories.
- Do not change any payout, support center, or KYC logic in this task.
