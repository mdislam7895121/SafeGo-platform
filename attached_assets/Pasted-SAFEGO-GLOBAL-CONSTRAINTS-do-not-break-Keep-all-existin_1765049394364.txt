SAFEGO GLOBAL CONSTRAINTS (do not break):
- Keep all existing roles (Customer, Driver, Restaurant, Admin), KYC logic, country-specific rules, DB schemas, and APIs unchanged.
- Do NOT rename or remove any fields in the restaurants collection (country, KYC, status, commission, etc.).
- Only improve the UI/UX of the Admin > Restaurants > Restaurant Management table.

TASK: Make the Restaurant Management table fully visible and professionally responsive on a standard laptop screen.

1) Table container with horizontal scroll:
   - Wrap the restaurants table in a container that allows horizontal scrolling:
       overflow-x: auto;
       overflow-y: visible;
       max-width: 100%;
   - The horizontal scrollbar must appear inside the table area, not on the whole page.
   - Do NOT hide overflow on the x-axis for this table.

2) Table width and layout:
   - Use a responsive table layout with:
       table-layout: auto;
       min-width: max-content;  // so columns don’t squish unreadably
   - Ensure the table can grow wider than the viewport, but is always scrollable.

3) Sticky first column:
   - Make the “Restaurant” column (name + address) sticky on the left:
       position: sticky;
       left: 0;
       z-index: 2;
       background: same as table background;
   - This way, when scrolling horizontally, the restaurant name remains visible.

4) Column priority and responsive behavior:
   - On laptop widths, always keep these columns visible without hiding:
       Restaurant, Email, Country, KYC, Status.
   - Less critical columns (e.g., created_at, updated_at, internal IDs, advanced flags) can:
       - either be collapsed into a “More”/“Details” popover per row, or
       - be hidden behind a “Show/Hide Columns” control.
   - Do NOT remove any data; only change how it is displayed.

5) Column visibility / settings:
   - Add a small “Columns” button above the table (next to Search / Filters) that lets the admin toggle visibility of non-critical columns.
   - Persist the user’s column preferences in local storage or in a safe admin setting (optional, but preferred).

6) Maintain the glow-card layout:
   - Keep the existing purple glow and card styling for the Search & Filters block at the top.
   - If the table itself is wrapped in a card, keep that card’s radius, padding, and glow consistent with the rest of the Admin panel.

7) Scrolling and performance:
   - Ensure that horizontal scrolling is smooth and does not cause the page layout to shake.
   - Test with many restaurant rows (e.g., 50–100) to confirm the table remains responsive and readable.

8) Testing:
   - Test on a 13–15 inch laptop resolution.
   - Verify that all important columns are accessible by scrolling right.
   - Confirm that no columns are clipped off-screen and that the admin can always reach every column either by horizontal scroll or via the “More / Columns” options.

Goal:
Make the Admin > Restaurants > Restaurant Management table feel like a professional Uber / DoorDash admin grid: fully scrollable horizontally, with a sticky name column, clear column priorities, and no hidden data off the right edge of the screen.
