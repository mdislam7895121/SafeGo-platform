Goal: Fix the SafeGo login page "Sign up" action and build a complete, publish-ready signup entry flow for all public roles (customer and partners), following SafeGo's company rules.

You must complete everything end-to-end in a single cycle so that a new user can sign up and reach the correct onboarding screen without errors.

Scope:

1) Diagnose and fix the /login "Sign up" / "Sign up" link

- Locate the login page component (e.g. client/src/pages/login.tsx or similar).
- Find the "Don't have an account? Sign up" text.
- Verify:
  - The "Sign up" element is a proper link or button.
  - It is wired to the front-end router (no missing href, no dead onClick).
- Fix so that:
  - On desktop click and mobile tap, the user is navigated to a dedicated signup entry route (e.g. /signup).
  - There is no JavaScript error or blocked navigation.
  - The element is accessible (role="link"/"button", keyboard focus works).

2) Implement a proper /signup entry route (global signup hub)

Create or fix a dedicated signup entry page, e.g. /signup, that:

- Uses the existing SafeGo design system (same typography, spacing, and button style as /login).
- Asks for:
  - Country: Bangladesh (BD) and United States (US) as primary options.
  - Role: Customer, Driver, Shop Partner, Ticket Operator, Rental Partner.
- Enforces SafeGo global logic:
  - For BD:
    - Customer → allowed
    - Driver (ride/parcel) → allowed, route to driver onboarding
    - Shop Partner → allowed, route to /shop-partner/onboarding
    - Ticket Operator → allowed, route to ticket onboarding
    - Rental Partner → allowed, route to BD rental onboarding
  - For US:
    - Customer → allowed now
    - All partner roles (driver, shop, ticket, rental) should show "Coming soon" and be disabled.
- Make sure labels and helper texts are shown in Bengali for BD and English for US where appropriate, matching existing localization style.

3) Route wiring from /signup to each onboarding flow

Wire the signup choices to the correct routes:

- BD Customer:
  - If the user is new → start BD customer experience (e.g. /customer/bd-start or the main /customer home with demo content).
- US Customer:
  - Route to US customer onboarding/home.
- BD Driver:
  - Route to /driver/onboarding (or the existing driver signup start route).
- BD Shop Partner:
  - Route to /shop-partner/onboarding (the multi-stage form you already built).
- BD Ticket Operator:
  - Route to ticket operator onboarding route.
- BD Rental Partner:
  - Route to rental partner onboarding route.

When navigating:
- Preserve the JWT/auth context if the user is already logged-in (e.g. clicking "Become a partner" while logged in).
- If the user is not logged in, ensure that the signup flow first collects email + password and then continues to the role onboarding (reuse existing auth backend, do not duplicate).

4) Handle existing users and security

Implement robust backend checks so that:

- If an email already has a SafeGo account:
  - The signup attempt for the same email returns a clear error:
    - English: "You already have a SafeGo account with this email. Please sign in instead."
    - Bengali equivalent for BD flows.
- If a logged-in user tries to create another account for the same email, prevent duplicate records.
- Ensure that role assignments are controlled:
  - Do not automatically grant admin or internal roles from this public signup screen.
  - Only allow: customer, driver, shop_partner, ticket_operator, rental_partner based on country rules above.
- Make sure all validation is done server-side:
  - Required fields present.
  - Email format valid.
  - Password meets existing SafeGo password policy.

5) Mobile-first and UX validation

- Test and fix the signup flow on:
  - iPhone (Safari) and Android (Chrome) using the preview domain.
- Requirements:
  - The "Sign up" link on /login is easily tappable.
  - The /signup screen fits on small mobile screens without horizontal scrolling.
  - Country/role buttons are large and thumb-friendly.
  - Navigation from /login → /signup → onboarding works with no blank screens or infinite spinners.

6) Regression checks

- Make sure existing login behavior is unchanged:
  - /login sign-in for existing users still works.
  - JWT/session handling is untouched except where strictly necessary.
- Confirm that:
  - BD E-shop flows (shop partner onboarding, ticket operator onboarding, rental partner onboarding) are still working when reached via the new /signup flow.
  - No console errors appear in browser devtools when using the login and signup flow.

7) Final deliverable

- The application must be publish-ready:
  - A new user can:
    1) Open /login
    2) Tap "Sign up"
    3) Choose country and role
    4) Complete account creation
    5) Land on the correct onboarding/home screen without any errors.
- Provide a short summary in the Agent log of:
  - What was broken in the /login "Sign up" logic.
  - What routes and components were added or modified.
  - How the final signup entry flow works for BD and US.

Complete all of this in one loop. Do not leave partial fixes or TODO comments.
