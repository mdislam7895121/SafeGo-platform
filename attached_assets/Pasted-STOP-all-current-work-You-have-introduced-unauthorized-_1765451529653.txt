STOP all current work.

You have introduced unauthorized structural changes:
- minimal app structure
- new landing page
- Simplify landing page
- Lazy loading refactors
- New file: client/src/routes/AuthenticatedApp.tsx
- Edited App.tsx with new architecture
- Removed original landing routing behavior

These changes violate the SafeGo global architecture rules.

===============================
RESTORE REQUIRED — IMMEDIATELY
===============================

Your next task is:

1. **Perform a full audit** of your last 30 actions  
   Identify all files you modified:
   - App.tsx
   - index.tsx
   - router files
   - any new routes (AuthenticatedApp.tsx, etc.)
   - landing page components

2. **REVERT every change related to:**
   - new minimalist landing page
   - simplified app structure
   - lazy loading refactor attempts
   - new or altered routing models
   - new nested authenticated routing structure

3. **RESTORE the original SafeGo landing page exactly as it was**  
   using git history / checkpoints.

4. **RESTORE original App.tsx routing**, including:
   - "/" loads the original SafeGo landing page
   - "/login" and "/signup" unchanged
   - no role-based routing at startup
   - no new AuthenticatedApp wrapper
   - no new lazy-loading strategy

5. **Do NOT redesign anything.**  
   Your job is to **repair**, not to rebuild.

6. **After restore, run a full system stability test**:
   - landing page loads correctly
   - login works
   - signup works
   - ride/food/parcel pages load
   - admin dashboards load
   - BD/US country routes work
   - no WebSocket HMR errors
   - no “Unexpected end of input”

7. Give a CLEAN summary:
   - Which files were reverted
   - Which checkpoints you used
   - Confirmation that the original landing page is restored
   - Confirmation all other modules still work

Do not introduce ANY new architecture, files, or design.  
ONLY RESTORE what we had before your breaking changes.
