Step 34 – Add US state filter (New York focus) to Driver Management list

Context:
- Admin driver list page: /admin/drivers
- Current filters: search by email, country (All Countries / Bangladesh / United States), status, verification
- USA driver identity already supports a "state" field (e.g., NY for New York).
- New York drivers have extra TLC requirements on the detail page, but the list view cannot yet filter NY drivers.

Goal:
Extend the existing Driver Management filters so that admins can easily filter United States drivers by state, starting with New York (NY), without breaking any existing behavior.

Requirements:

1. New "State" filter (conditional)
   - Add a new dropdown filter labeled "State" in the Search & Filters row on /admin/drivers.
   - This dropdown should:
     - Be visible only when the country filter = "United States".
     - Be hidden/disabled when country is "All Countries" or "Bangladesh".

2. State filter options
   - Default option: "All States".
   - At minimum include:
     - "All States"
     - "New York (NY)"
   - Implementation should be future-proof so more US states can be added later without structural changes.

3. Filtering behavior
   - When Country = "United States" AND State = "All States":
     - Show all US drivers (regardless of their state value).
   - When Country = "United States" AND State = "New York (NY)":
     - Show only drivers where:
       - driver.countryCode (or equivalent field) = "US"
       - AND driver.state (or equivalent) = "NY"
   - When Country is "Bangladesh" or "All Countries":
     - Ignore the state filter and hide it from the UI.

4. URL & query parameters
   - Keep the same pattern used for existing filters (country, status, verification).
   - Add a new query parameter for the state filter (for example: &state=NY or &state=all).
   - Ensure:
     - URL is updated when the state filter changes.
     - Filters are restored from the URL on page load (so deep links/bookmarks keep working).

5. UI/UX consistency
   - Match existing filter styling, spacing, and responsive layout.
   - State dropdown should not push content out of alignment on smaller screens.
   - On mobile, it should stack neatly with the other filters.

6. Backend / data access
   - Prefer reusing the existing driver list query and extend it with an optional "state" condition.
   - Do NOT change any database schema or existing fields.
   - If some USA drivers do not yet have a state set:
     - They must still appear when "All States" is selected.
     - They must NOT appear when "New York (NY)" is selected (unless their state is explicitly NY).

7. Non-breaking & security
   - No changes to role-based access control or protected routes.
   - No changes to commission, wallet, or KYC logic.
   - Confirm:
     - No regressions for BD drivers.
     - No regressions in existing US driver listing and filters.
   - Keep all changes backward compatible with existing data.

8. Verification checklist
   - Test 1: Country = All Countries → State filter hidden → all drivers load as before.
   - Test 2: Country = Bangladesh → State filter hidden → only BD drivers load.
   - Test 3: Country = United States, State = All States → all US drivers visible.
   - Test 4: Country = United States, State = New York (NY) → only NY drivers visible.
   - Test 5: Refresh the page with filters set → filters restored from URL and results preserved.
   - Test 6: Quick sanity check that /admin/drivers still works correctly with other filters (status, verification).

9. Documentation
   - Update replit.md (or existing admin docs) briefly describing:
     - The new State filter.
     - How to filter New York drivers.
     - Notes that this is currently only used for US drivers and is optional.

Please implement this as a safe, incremental change:
- No breaking schema changes.
- No impact on Steps 26–33 (Parcel Management, Identity, Document uploads, Wallet/Commission).
- Keep the code clean and consistent with existing filter implementation.
