COMMISSION & PAYOUT LOGIC
====================================
1) Ride – CASH:
   - Driver receives full cash.
   - SafeGo commission → negative driver_wallet_balance.
   - Driver settles weekly; admin marks as paid.

2) Food – CASH:
   - Restaurant receives all cash.
   - Commission → negative restaurant_wallet_balance.

3) ONLINE:
   - SafeGo collects payment.
   - SafeGo keeps safego_commission_amount automatically.
   - Driver/restaurant only get net payout.

4) Admin can settle and mark negative balances paid.

====================================
SECURITY RULES
====================================
- Customers cannot view driver documents (NID, license, SSN, etc.).
- Drivers cannot view customer KYC or sensitive info.
- Restaurants cannot view other restaurants.
- Only Admin can change:
  - pricing, commissions
  - verification_status
  - block/unblock users
- Users can update only their own profile.

TASK: UPDATE DRIVER QUICK ACTIONS PANEL – KEEP ONLY "TRIP HISTORY"
====================================

Screen: Driver app – the bottom Quick Actions sheet that opens from the circular button near the bottom-left of the map on `/driver/map`.

Current behavior:
- When the driver taps the bottom-left FAB (Quick Actions / grid button), a panel appears with:
  - Earnings
  - Trip History
  - Wallet
  - Profile

New requirement:
- This Quick Actions panel must show **only one item**:
  - Trip History
- The other three shortcuts (Earnings, Wallet, Profile) must be removed from this panel only.

VERY IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT delete or disable the Earnings / Wallet / Profile features themselves.
- Only remove them from this specific **Quick Actions** panel.
- The main left navigation menu and other entry points for Earnings, Wallet, Profile must continue to work exactly as before.

------------------------------------
1) Locate the Quick Actions component
------------------------------------
- Find the React component (or UI module) used on the driver side that renders the **“Quick Actions”** list.
  - It might be something like `<DriverQuickActions />` or a list/array named `quickActions`.
- Confirm that it currently renders four rows:
  - Earnings
  - Trip History
  - Wallet
  - Profile

------------------------------------
2) Restrict Quick Actions to Trip History only
------------------------------------
Adjust the data or JSX so that only Trip History remains.

Example (data-driven pattern BEFORE):

```ts
const quickActions = [
  { id: "earnings", label: "Earnings", icon: DollarIcon, route: "/driver/earnings" },
  { id: "trips", label: "Trip History", icon: HistoryIcon, route: "/driver/trips" },
  { id: "wallet", label: "Wallet", icon: WalletIcon, route: "/driver/wallet" },
  { id: "profile", label: "Profile", icon: UserIcon, route: "/driver/profile" },
];
