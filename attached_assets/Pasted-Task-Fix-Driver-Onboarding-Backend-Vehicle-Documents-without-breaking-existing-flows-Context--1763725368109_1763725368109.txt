Task: Fix Driver Onboarding Backend (Vehicle + Documents) without breaking existing flows

Context:
- SafeGo is a multi-role platform (customer, driver, restaurant, admin).
- Admin side is stable (wallets, payouts, reconciliation, tax & fees, analytics).
- Customer side: registration, KYC, login, ride request, and food browsing are working.
- Driver dashboard has these tabs: Overview, Vehicle, Documents, Payouts, Account.

Current issues (driver side):
1) Vehicle registration
   - When submitting the "Register Vehicle" form from Driver > Vehicle tab,
     we get a red toast:
       500: {"error":"Failed to register vehicle"}
   - UI stays on the same page; no vehicle is created.
   - Driver Overview still shows "No vehicle registered" and onboarding progress
     does not move forward.

2) Driver documents upload
   - On Driver > Documents tab (Profile Photo, Driver License, Vehicle Documents),
     uploading any document shows:
       500: {"error":"Failed to upload vehicle document"}
   - No document records are created; the "Required Documents" list stays as
     "Not uploaded" or "0 uploaded".

Goal:
- Make the entire driver onboarding backend work end-to-end:
  - A driver can register a vehicle.
  - A driver can upload required documents.
  - The dashboard and onboarding progress reflect the correct state.

Requirements & Expected Behaviour:

1. Vehicle registration
   - Use the existing data model for vehicles; do NOT introduce breaking schema changes.
   - On successful registration:
     - Create or update a vehicle record linked to the authenticated driver.
     - Fields: make, model, year (if present), licensePlate, color/bodyType if the form sends it,
       countryCode and city/jurisdiction if available.
     - Mark the vehicle status appropriately (e.g., "pending_review" initially).
   - Driver > Vehicle tab should then show the registered vehicle instead of "No vehicle registered".
   - Onboarding progress:
     - "Vehicle Added" step should switch from Pending to Completed once a vehicle exists.

2. Driver documents upload
   - Use the existing storage approach (local/replit file storage or in-DB blobs) already used
     elsewhere in the app; do not introduce external storage providers.
   - For each document upload:
     - Create a document record associated with the driver (and vehicle where applicable).
     - Types:
       - profile_photo
       - driver_license
       - vehicle_registration
       - insurance
       - other_vehicle_document
     - Store at minimum: id, driverId, vehicleId (nullable), type, filename, mimeType,
       size, storagePath/url, createdAt.
   - After a successful upload:
     - The corresponding item in Driver > Documents should update from
       "Not uploaded" to something like "1 uploaded" or show a check/icon.
     - Onboarding progress:
       - "KYC Documents" and "Vehicle Documents" steps should update as documents are added.

3. Security & Validation
   - All driver onboarding endpoints must:
     - Require authentication.
     - Use the existing RBAC / getRBACFilter / driver scope helpers.
     - Ensure a driver can only access their own vehicle and documents.
   - Add sensible validation:
     - Reject empty or invalid payloads.
     - Enforce max file size limits consistent with UI (5MB profile photo, 10MB docs).
   - For invalid payloads or file issues, return a 400 with a clear JSON error message
     and show a friendly toast to the user. 500 should be reserved for real server errors.

4. Error handling & logging
   - Replace the generic "Failed to register vehicle" / "Failed to upload vehicle document"
     with:
       - Logged error details on the server (console or logger).
       - Clean JSON responses (e.g., { error: "Invalid file type" }).
   - Make sure customer and admin flows are not impacted.

5. UI wiring (minimal)
   - Reuse existing forms and components; do not redesign the UI here.
   - Just ensure:
     - Forms call the correct fixed endpoints.
     - Loading states & success toasts work.
     - The Driver Overview page correctly reflects:
       - Vehicle added / not added.
       - Documents status (warnings only when something is truly missing).

6. Demo / seed data
   - Optionally add seed/demo data for:
     - One driver with a demo vehicle and documents,
     to help quickly verify the flow in preview.
   - Document in replit.md how to test:
     1) How to login as demo driver.
     2) How to register a new vehicle.
     3) How to upload driver and vehicle documents.
     4) How to see the updated onboarding progress and dashboard.

Constraints:
- Do not change any working customer or admin behaviour.
- No breaking Prisma migrations; prefer additive or compatible changes.
- Preserve existing naming conventions for services, routes, and models.
- Keep changes focused on driver onboarding (vehicle + documents).

Acceptance Criteria:
- Registering a vehicle as a driver completes successfully (no 500) and appears on the
  Vehicle tab and Overview.
- Uploading profile photo, driver license, and at least one vehicle document works
  without 500 errors, and the Documents tab reflects the uploads.
- Onboarding Progress updates its steps correctly for Vehicle Added, Vehicle Documents,
  and KYC Documents.
- All relevant endpoints are authenticated and restricted to the current driver.
- replit.md contains an updated "Driver Onboarding QA" section with clear test steps.
