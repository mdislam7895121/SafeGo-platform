You must follow all SafeGo rules and never break any existing Ride/Eats/Parcel logic.  
Your task is focused ONLY on improving the customer-side live map so that the user can see their own real-time location exactly like Uber.

Problem:
The customer live map does not show the customer’s current GPS location. The map loads but stays centered on a generic bounding box. There is no blue-dot indicator and no real-time movement.

Expected (Uber-style):
1. On every customer map (home screen, ride screen, and live tracking screen):
   - Show the customer’s current location as a blue circular marker.
   - Continuously update location using `navigator.geolocation.watchPosition`.
   - Smoothly animate movement when the customer changes position.
   - Recenter only on the first load (not every frame).
   - Ensure the driver tracking logic remains untouched.

2. Must NOT break:
   - Ride flow
   - Driver tracking
   - Mobile responsiveness
   - The unified-booking screen structure
   - Existing routes, icons, or polyline logic

3. Apply this fix ONLY for the customer, NOT the driver.

Implementation requirements:

A. Create a reusable customer location hook:
   - File suggestion: `client/src/hooks/useCustomerLocation.ts`
   - Use:
       - `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition` for initial fetch
       - `navigator.geolocation.watchPosition` for live tracking
   - Store:
       - `lat`, `lng`
       - `accuracy`
       - `heading`
       - `speed`
       - `timestamp`
   - Include cleanup for `watchPosition`.

B. Add a blue GPS marker on the map:
   - Use a circular marker (Uber-style).
   - Do not replace the driver or route markers.
   - Marker must update when state changes.

C. Modify customer map views:
   Files likely affected:
   - `client/src/pages/customer/unified-booking.tsx`
   - `client/src/components/map/CustomerMap.tsx` (or equivalent)
   
   Add:
   - Import the new hook.
   - Add the blue customer marker.
   - Center the map only on initial load:
        - If the user just opened the page → center on customer location.
        - After that → do NOT force recenter to avoid map “jumping”.
   - If customer location is unavailable, fallback to last known or default center.

D. Permissions handling:
   - Show non-intrusive prompt if location permission is denied.
   - Must not break any existing UI.

E. Mobile behavior:
   - Ensure the blue dot works in mobile Preview.
   - Ensure it also works inside the “View live map” full screen.

F. Quality/Security:
   - No API keys in frontend.
   - Keep all map logic consistent with existing driver tracking.

Deliverables:
- The complete updated code for:
   1) The new customer location hook
   2) All required map file updates
- Confirm that:
   - The customer sees their live moving location (blue dot)
   - Map centers correctly on load
   - Nothing from ride tracking or UI is broken
