SAFEGO — FINAL MAP DESIGN DECISION (LIGHT CLEAN MAP)

Final decision:
Use a LIGHT, CLEAN, Google-Maps-style map.
Dark or earth/muddy maps are NOT acceptable.

Hard rules (must not break):
- Frontend only.
- Do NOT touch backend, APIs, pricing, KYC, wallets, schemas, or status flows.
- Preserve all routes and existing logic.
- Minimal, safe changes.

TARGET MAP STYLE (MANDATORY):

1) Base map:
- Light background (white / very light grey).
- Clear separation between land, roads, water, and parks.
- No dark mode.
- No brown or earth tones.
- High readability at a glance.

2) Roads:
- Highways: yellow/orange, clearly visible.
- Primary roads: light orange.
- Secondary roads: light grey.
- Roads must be clearly distinguishable from land.

3) Labels:
- Clean, readable city/area names.
- Not cluttered.
- Similar density to Google Maps.

4) Route line:
- Single clean blue or cyan color.
- Medium thickness (not thin, not neon).
- Route must be the most visually prominent element.
- No glow effects.

5) Markers:
- Pickup: simple blue dot.
- Dropoff: simple red dot.
- No large icons, no arrows, no cartoon graphics.

6) Cancel behavior (critical):
- On cancel:
  - Route line disappears immediately.
  - Dropoff marker disappears.
  - No ghost or stale route redraw.
- Async/stale protection MUST remain.

7) What to REMOVE:
- Any dark map tiles.
- Any earth/brown tone tiles.
- Any opacity/fog overlays.
- Any “muddy” or low-contrast styling.

Implementation notes:
- If Leaflet: switch to a clean light tile provider (Google-like look).
- If Mapbox: use a light style (not dark).
- Ensure contrast and readability are the top priority.

Verification checklist (must pass):
- Roads are instantly understandable.
- No “muddy” or confusing areas.
- Route is obvious and clean.
- Cancel leaves map perfectly clean.
- Customers can understand the map without thinking.

Deliverables:
- List files changed.
- Show final code diff.
- Confirm: “Light clean map applied as default.”

STOP if unsure:
- List candidate files and stop. Do not guess.

END.
