Follow ALL SafeGo Master Rules.

Provide a complete and fully detailed project status report covering the entire SafeGo Driver App and Customer App.  
Your report must include ALL four sections below, with no skipping and no summarizing.  
Every statement must be accurate and based on the current codebase.

-----------------------------------------
1. COMPLETED WORK (100% functional)
-----------------------------------------
List everything that is fully working in both Driver App and Customer App:
- Screens
- Components
- Trip flows (demo or real)
- Map behaviors
- Buttons
- Routing
- Backend endpoints
- KYC flows
- Dashboard elements
- Document center features
- Any logic or UI that is finished

Be exhaustive. Nothing should be missed.

-----------------------------------------
2. PARTIALLY COMPLETED WORK
-----------------------------------------
List all features that are visible but not fully functional.
For each item, clearly state:
- What part works
- What part is incomplete
- What logic is missing
- What UI is missing
- What backend support is missing

This MUST include verification of:
- Driver Online/Offline logic
- Trip Preferences select/deselect + persistence
- USA/BD trip type separation
- Recenter button accuracy
- Demo mode limitations
- Safety report routing
- Document upload “access token required”
- Customer profile button not opening
- Trip matching not connected to backend
- Anything else partly done

-----------------------------------------
3. INCOMPLETE / MISSING WORK
-----------------------------------------
List ALL remaining work that still needs to be built.

Minimum items to include:
- Real-time trip matching (Customer → Driver)
- Full real Ride flow (non-demo)
- Full real Food Delivery flow
- Full real Parcel Delivery flow
- Driver earnings calculation after each trip
- Driver incentives logic
- Driver cancellation / no-show flow
- Customer account page (profile, wallet, trips, help)
- Customer Eats order placing & tracking
- Customer Parcel booking flow
- Push notifications (driver, customer, restaurant)
- Restaurant dashboard (menus, orders, payouts)
- Full BD vs USA service separation
- Any missing verification/KYC screens
- Any missing admin panel functions

Do NOT skip anything.

-----------------------------------------
4. NEXT REQUIRED TASKS (STRICT PRIORITY ORDER)
-----------------------------------------
Provide a step-by-step task list of what must be implemented next.

Minimum required priority items:
1. Fix driver Online/Offline backend state
2. Fix Trip Preference toggle + save/load
3. Fix current location recenter
4. Fix Document Upload authentication
5. Fix Customer Profile button navigation
6. Fix Safety Report routing
7. Implement real Customer → Driver trip matching
8. Implement real trip lifecycle (accepted → arriving → in_progress → completed)
9. Implement earnings update after trip
10. Implement real Food Delivery flow
11. Implement real Parcel Delivery flow

Explain why each step is needed, and how it fits the SafeGo system.

-----------------------------------------
REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------------------------
- Follow ALL SafeGo Master Rules and DO NOT break any existing schema, route, or API.
- The report must be complete enough for another engineer to continue development without confusion.
- No assumptions. No skipping. No short-form answers.
