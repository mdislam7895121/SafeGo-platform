Act as a senior product designer and system architect for SafeGo.

Goal: Implement the SafeGo Points system using ONLY four tiers with the following order:
1. Blue (500–999)
2. Gold (1000–1999)
3. Premium (2000–2999)
4. Diamond (3000+)

Important: Premium must always appear BEFORE Diamond in all UI tables, API responses, admin pages, tier ladders, and calculation logic.

There is NO Basic tier.  
Drivers below 500 points must be considered “no tier yet”.

Follow all existing SafeGo conventions:
- Four roles: customer, driver, restaurant, admin
- Keep all existing KYC, payouts, rides, food, and delivery logic untouched
- Do not break any existing URLs or layouts
- Follow clean, white, Uber-style UI with left-aligned layout
- Do not touch wallet, fare logic, or payouts

-----------------------------
DRIVER UI REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------------

Route: /driver/points  
Sidebar label: SafeGo Points

If total_points < 500:
- Show state “You have not unlocked a tier yet”
- Show message “Earn 500 points to unlock Blue tier”
- Progress bar 0–500

If total_points >= 500:
- Show current tier
- Show progress bar to next tier
- Show total points
- Show tier ladder table in EXACT order:
    Blue → Gold → Premium → Diamond

Tier ranges:
- Blue: 500–999
- Gold: 1000–1999
- Premium: 2000–2999
- Diamond: 3000+

Include activity ledger (date, event, reference, points delta).

-----------------------------
BACKEND LOGIC
-----------------------------

Tables to use:
- driver_points_summary
- driver_points_ledger
- points_tiers
- points_rules

Seed the default four tiers with this order_index:
- Blue: order_index = 1
- Gold: order_index = 2
- Premium: order_index = 3
- Diamond: order_index = 4

Tier calculation:
- Select all active tiers for the country (fallback global)
- Sort tiers by order_index ascending
- Choose the highest tier where total_points >= min_points
- If total_points < 500 → current_tier = null

This ensures Premium is ALWAYS before Diamond.

-----------------------------
ADMIN PANEL REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------------

Add “SafeGo Points” in admin.
Include:
1. Tier Management
2. Rules Management
3. Driver Overview

Tier table must show:
- Blue  
- Gold  
- Premium  
- Diamond  
in this exact order.

No Basic tier.

Admins may NOT reorder tiers manually.  
Premium must remain before Diamond permanently.

-----------------------------
SECURITY RULES
-----------------------------

- Drivers can only view their own points & ledger
- Admin changes require audit logging
- No conversion of points to money
- Wallet remains untouched

-----------------------------
DONE
-----------------------------

Implement all pages, API endpoints, backend logic, migrations, and UI updates to reflect this tier order.

Report back with:
- What changed
- How tiers are calculated
- How the ordering is enforced everywhere
