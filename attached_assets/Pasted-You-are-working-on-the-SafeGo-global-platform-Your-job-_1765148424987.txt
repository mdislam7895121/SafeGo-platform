You are working on the SafeGo global platform.  
Your job in THIS task: 

1) Change the driver flow AFTER application submission so that:
   - The driver is redirected to the Driver Dashboard (home) — not stuck forever on the Under Review page.
   - The Go Online action is blocked when verification is still pending, and shows an Uber-style “Your documents are under review” message.
2) Keep the separate Driver Status page (`/partner/driver/status`) to show full application details when the driver wants to view them.
3) Respect ALL SafeGo master rules (roles, KYC, admin verification, collections, commission, security, status flows, notifications) and make changes NON-BREAKING.

======================================================
A) SAFEGO MASTER RULES (SUMMARY – DO NOT BREAK)
======================================================

1) Roles (must stay separate)
   - Customer
   - Driver
   - Restaurant (Merchant)
   - Admin

   Each role has:
   - Its own onboarding flow
   - Its own dashboard
   - Its own permissions and status flows
   No cross-access to sensitive data between roles.

2) Services (must be supported end-to-end)
   - Ride-hailing
   - Food delivery
   - Parcel delivery

3) Country-specific KYC (BD vs US)
   - Bangladesh (BD) drivers:
     - father_name, date_of_birth, present_address, permanent_address
     - NID_number, NID_front_image, NID_back_image
     - emergency_contact_name / phone / relation
     - verification_status, is_verified

   - United States (US) drivers:
     - date_of_birth, home_address
     - emergency_contact_name / phone / relation
     - government_id_type, government_id_last4
     - driver_license_number, driver_license_image_front, driver_license_image_back, driver_license_expiry
     - ssn_last4 (optional)
     - for NYC: TLC license images if needed
     - verification_status, is_verified

   - For NYC: FHV Number must NOT be required in the UI. TLC images are sufficient (do not delete DB column, just don’t require it).

4) Admin panel must:
   - Approve / reject / block drivers, customers, restaurants
   - Set `verification_status`, `is_verified`, and `rejection_reason`
   - Control pricing, fees, commissions
   - Manage payouts and negative balances

5) Collections – must keep:
   - rides
   - food_orders
   - deliveries

   Each with:
   - customer_id, driver_id (and restaurant_id for food_orders)
   - pickup/dropoff addresses + geolocation
   - fees, commission, driver/restaurant earnings
   - payment_method, payment_status, transaction_id
   - full status flows (rides, food, parcel)
   - ratings and feedback

6) Commission rules:
   - Cash ride: driver keeps cash, SafeGo commission becomes negative balance in driver_wallet_balance.
   - Cash food order: restaurant keeps cash, commission becomes negative balance in restaurant_wallet.
   - Online payments: SafeGo keeps commission automatically.
   - Admin can settle balances.

7) Security:
   - Drivers can’t see customer NID or sensitive documents.
   - Customers can’t see driver documents.
   - Restaurants can’t see other restaurants.
   - Only Admin can change pricing, commission, verification, blocking.
   - Users can update only THEIR own profile.

8) Onboarding:
   - Multi-step (basic info, address, KYC, emergency contact).
   - After submission: `verification_status = "pending"`, `is_verified = false`.
   - No access to live operations until approved by Admin.

9) Notifications:
   - New ride/order/parcel alerts
   - Status updates
   - Verification approval/rejection
   - Important admin messages

10) Non-breaking:
   - Do NOT remove or rename existing API/DB fields or routes.
   - Only add logic, components, and optional fields.

======================================================
B) NEW DRIVER FLOW AFTER APPLICATION SUBMISSION
======================================================

Current behavior (buggy):
- After final KYC submit, the driver is sent to `/partner/driver/status` which shows:
  “Your Application Is Under Review” + application details.
- The driver gets stuck here and cannot reach the Driver Dashboard to see the Go Online button.

DESIRED behavior (Uber-style):

1) After final driver KYC submission succeeds:
   - Backend sets:
     - verification_status = "pending"
     - is_verified = false
   - FRONTEND must:
     - Redirect the driver to the **Driver Dashboard** (driver home), not the Under Review page.
       Example destination route (use the correct one from the codebase):
       - `/driver`
       - or `/partner/driver/dashboard`
       - or similar.

2) On Driver Dashboard:
   - There MUST be:
     - A clear Go Online / Go Offline control.
     - A visible “View Application Status” link or button that opens `/partner/driver/status` (or equivalent).

3) When the driver taps Go Online:
   - The app must check the driver verification flags:

   PSEUDOCODE:

   ```ts
   if (!driver.is_verified || driver.verification_status !== 'approved') {
     // Block going online
     showUnderReviewModalOrBanner();
   } else {
     // Allow going online
     setOnlineStatus(true);
   }
