You are upgrading the SafeGo multi-service platform to add an Uber-style Food Ordering system.

⚠️ Hard rules (must not break):
- Do NOT break any existing flows: rides, KYC, wallets, payouts, earnings, analytics, tax & fees, RBAC, demo mode.
- Keep the 4-role model intact: CUSTOMER, DRIVER, RESTAURANT, ADMIN.
- Keep existing jurisdiction logic and RBAC filters (SUPER_ADMIN, COUNTRY_ADMIN, CITY_ADMIN, etc).
- All changes must be backward-compatible and non-destructive.

Goal for this task (Food Step 1 – Architecture & Read-Only APIs):
- Implement the first slice of the Food Ordering system on the CUSTOMER side:
  1) Safe domain architecture for food.
  2) Read-only APIs for restaurants and menus.
  3) Basic customer UI screens to browse restaurants and see menus.
- Do NOT implement cart/checkout or order placement in this step. Only browsing.

Context alignment:
1. Inspect the existing codebase and summarize (in comments / replit.md) what already exists for:
   - RestaurantProfile / restaurants
   - FoodOrder / Delivery or any similar models
   - Wallets, payouts, tax & fees (for later integration)
   - Existing customer app routes and layouts
2. Reuse or extend existing models instead of creating duplicates.
   - If a FoodOrder model already exists, do NOT redesign it; just note how it will be used later.

Data layer (Prisma or current ORM):
1. Add or confirm minimal models needed for read-only restaurant + menu browsing, for example:
   - RestaurantProfile (already exists – reuse)
   - MenuCategory
   - MenuItem
2. For each model, use:
   - isActive flags
   - countryCode / cityCode or equivalent for jurisdiction filtering
   - isDemo flag where appropriate (aligned with existing demo mode).
3. Write clear comments on these models so later steps can use them for ordering, tax, and payouts.

Backend APIs (customer-facing):
Create a dedicated, RBAC-protected customer food API surface, for example under something like:
- GET /api/customer/food/restaurants
- GET /api/customer/food/restaurants/:id
- GET /api/customer/food/restaurants/:id/menu

Requirements:
1. Only authenticated CUSTOMERS can call these endpoints.
2. Apply existing jurisdiction filters (country/city) just like ride/analytics data:
   - Customers should only see restaurants in their allowed city/country.
3. Implement defensive patterns you already use:
   - safeNumber / safeString / safeArray helpers
   - Optional chaining and null-safe defaults in responses
4. Responses must be shaped specifically for the customer app (no internal admin-only fields).
5. Add basic logging for these routes so admin analytics can be extended later.

Customer app UI (read-only, minimal but production-ready skeleton):
Add new routes and pages without breaking existing ones:

1. Routes (or equivalent):
   - /customer/food          → Restaurant list
   - /customer/food/:id      → Restaurant details + menu

2. Restaurant list screen:
   - Reuse existing customer layout and navigation style.
   - Show:
     - Restaurant name
     - Cuisine type / short description
     - Average rating (if available)
     - City and area
   - Include simple filters or placeholders (e.g., “All cuisines”, “Sort by rating”) even if non-functional for now.

3. Restaurant details + menu screen:
   - Show restaurant information at the top.
   - Under that, show categories and items:
     - Category name (e.g., “Burgers”, “Drinks”)
     - For each item: name, short description, price, and a disabled “Add to cart” button or a non-functional CTA.
   - Do NOT implement cart logic yet. The CTA can simply be a placeholder with a TODO.

Security & KYC rules:
1. Only KYC-approved customers should see the Food tab/entry point in the customer app.
2. If a non-KYC customer tries to access /customer/food routes:
   - Redirect them to KYC / verification or show a friendly “Complete verification to order food” message.
3. Make sure RBAC and authentication follow the same middleware stack you already use for ride tracking and wallets.

Admin & analytics compatibility:
1. Do NOT build any new admin UI here.
2. However, structure the APIs and models so later we can:
   - Track food orders in earnings and analytics dashboards.
   - Link restaurant revenue and commission to existing wallets/payouts/tax structures.

Testing & validation:
1. Add a small set of demo restaurants and menu items to the existing demo data script so that:
   - When demo mode is enabled, the new customer food screens show realistic data (for NYC, SF, Dhaka).
2. Manually test:
   - Customer login → KYC-approved user → navigate to /customer/food and /customer/food/:id.
   - Confirm API responses are non-empty with demo mode enabled.
   - Confirm unauthorized or non-KYC customers cannot access food routes.
3. Check browser console and server logs:
   - No runtime errors.
   - All new routes show 200 OK responses.
   - Memory warnings acceptable but no crashes.

Documentation:
1. Update replit.md with a new section:
   - “SafeGo Food System – Step 1: Restaurant & Menu Browsing”
   - Describe:
     - Models used/added
     - API endpoints and request/response shapes
     - RBAC and jurisdiction rules
     - What is implemented now (browse only) vs what is planned next (cart, checkout, orders, tracking).

When you finish:
- Summarize exactly what was added or changed.
- Confirm that no existing features were broken (rides, wallets, earnings, payouts, analytics, tax & fees, RBAC).
- Tell me how to navigate in the customer app to see the restaurant list and menu screens.
