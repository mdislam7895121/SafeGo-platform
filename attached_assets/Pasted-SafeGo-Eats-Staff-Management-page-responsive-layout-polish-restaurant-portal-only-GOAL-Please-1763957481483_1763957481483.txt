SafeGo Eats – Staff Management page responsive & layout polish (restaurant portal only)

GOAL
Please clean up and redesign the Staff Management page UI at `/restaurant/staff` so that:
- The page looks organized and professional.
- The Staff list and Add Staff form are fully usable on mobile, tablet, and laptop.
- No backend, routing, KYC, RBAC, or API behavior is changed.
- All existing functionality (staff counts, permissions, activity log, add staff, etc.) continues to work as before.

SCOPE
1. Page: Restaurant portal Staff Management
   - URL: `/restaurant/staff`
2. Keep as-is:
   - Global restaurant header (logo, Online toggle, restaurant identity block, search bar, notifications, profile avatar).
   - Online/Offline toggle design and position.
   - SafeGuard and KYC gating rules.
   - All existing actions: Activity Log, Add Staff, staff counters, permissions toggles.
3. You may adjust ONLY:
   - Layout, spacing, alignment, typography, and responsive behavior of the Staff Management content area.
   - Visual structure of the staff summary cards and Add Staff form (without changing the underlying data or endpoints).

A. STAFF MANAGEMENT HEADER BLOCK (BELOW GLOBAL HEADER)
1. Keep a single, clear section header:
   - Title: “Staff Management”
   - Subtitle: “Manage your restaurant staff and their permissions”
2. Alignment:
   - Left-aligned with the “mohammad” restaurant identity text block.
   - On mobile, title should not wrap awkwardly; use max-width and proper line-height.
3. Actions on the right:
   - Keep the existing “Activity Log” and “Add Staff” controls.
   - Layout on desktop:
     - Right-aligned in the same row as “Staff Management”.
     - Use horizontal spacing between Activity Log and Add Staff.
   - Layout on mobile:
     - Place Activity Log and Add Staff in a horizontal row under the title, but still within the same header section.
4. Spacing:
   - Top padding: 16–20px below the search bar.
   - Bottom margin: 16–20px before the first content card (Total Staff, etc.).

B. STAFF SUMMARY CARDS LAYOUT
1. Summary cards: Total Staff, Active, Blocked (and any others) must:
   - Stay in a clean card layout.
   - Use consistent margins and padding.
2. Desktop / wide screens:
   - Use a responsive grid (e.g., 2–3 cards per row depending on width).
3. Mobile:
   - Single-column layout (one card per row).
   - Full-width cards with 16px horizontal padding from screen edges.
4. Ensure:
   - No horizontal scroll on any breakpoint.
   - Cards never overlap or get clipped by the keyboard.

C. ADD STAFF FORM – RESPONSIVE & USABLE
This is the main problem area on mobile right now. Fix it carefully.

1. Form fields (Email, Phone, Temporary Password, etc.):
   - On mobile and tablet:
     - Single column layout.
     - Labels above inputs, 14–16px font, left-aligned.
     - Each input has enough vertical spacing (at least 12–16px margin between fields).
   - On desktop:
     - You may keep a 2-column layout where appropriate (e.g., Email + Phone side by side) as long as it never breaks on smaller screens.

2. Permissions section:
   - Ensure the “Permissions” title remains clearly visible above the list of toggles.
   - Each permission line (e.g., Edit Categories, Edit Menu Items, Toggle Availability, Use Bulk Tools, View Analytics, View Payouts, Manage Orders, etc.) should:
     - Use a two-column row:
       - Left: permission label text.
       - Right: toggle switch aligned vertically centered.
   - On mobile:
     - No text should be hidden behind the on-screen keyboard.
     - The user must be able to scroll to the bottom of the form without any overlap.

3. Scrolling behavior:
   - When the keyboard is open on mobile:
     - The page MUST be scrollable so that all fields (including the last permissions toggle and submit button) can be reached.
   - Avoid fixed heights that cause the lower part of the form to be cut off.

4. Submit / Save button:
   - Place the primary action button immediately AFTER the permissions section.
   - Ensure there is at least 16–24px padding below the button so it is not flush with the screen bottom.
   - Button must be full-width on mobile; appropriate width on desktop.

D. LAYOUT STRUCTURE BY BREAKPOINT

1. Mobile (up to ~768px):
   - Order:
     1) Global restaurant header (already implemented – do not change).
     2) Staff Management header block (title + subtitle + Activity Log / Add Staff).
     3) Staff summary cards.
     4) Add Staff form.
   - All in a single vertical column.
   - 16px horizontal page padding.
   - No overlapping between search bar, tabs, headings, and the form.

2. Tablet (~768–1024px):
   - Same order as mobile.
   - You may use 2 columns for summary cards.
   - Add Staff form remains a single column for clarity.

3. Desktop (>1024px):
   - Option A (preferred):
     - Keep a 2-column layout for the main content:
       - Left: Staff summary cards and list.
       - Right: Add Staff form card.
     - Ensure spacing between columns and equal top alignment under the Staff Management header.
   - The design must remain clean and not introduce any new headers.

E. DO NOT DO
- Do NOT modify any backend code, APIs, or data models.
- Do NOT change routing or URLs.
- Do NOT rename React components or files.
- Do NOT change Online/Offline toggle logic or SafeGuard/KYC logic.
- Do NOT remove or disable any existing staff-related functionality (Activity Log, Add Staff, staff counts, permissions).
- Do NOT introduce new navigation items.

F. ACCESSIBILITY & QUALITY
1. Ensure:
   - All form fields keep proper labels and focus styles.
   - All toggles remain keyboard accessible (Tab + Space/Enter).
2. No horizontal scroll on:
   - `/restaurant/staff` on mobile, tablet, desktop.
3. Font sizes and line height should be consistent with the rest of the restaurant portal.

G. FINAL VERIFICATION
After implementing:
1. Test `/restaurant/staff` on:
   - Narrow mobile viewport.
   - Tablet viewport.
   - Desktop viewport.
2. Confirm:
   - Staff Management header looks clean and aligned with the new Online toggle design.
   - Staff summary cards do not overlap and remain readable.
   - Add Staff form is fully usable on mobile with the keyboard open (all fields and the submit button reachable by scrolling).
   - Permissions list and toggles are fully visible and not cut off.
   - No layout regressions on other restaurant pages (dashboard, orders, menu, payouts, support, etc.).

This task is a pure UI/responsive cleanup for the Staff Management page. Do not alter any underlying business logic, permissions, or security behavior.
