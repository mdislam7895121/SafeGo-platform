Implement the full SafeGo Driver Incentive Engine that includes: 
Uber-style Quest Bonuses, Boost Zones, Weather Incentives, Airport Bonuses, and Late-Night Bonuses.

========================================================
A. QUEST BONUS SYSTEM (WEEKLY GOALS)
========================================================
Create a system that offers drivers bonus payouts when they complete a certain number of rides within a defined time window.

Rules:
1. Weekly cycles (Mon 00:00 – Sun 23:59)
2. Default Quest tiers:
   - Tier 1: 20 rides = $15 bonus
   - Tier 2: 40 rides = $40 bonus
   - Tier 3: 60 rides = $75 bonus
3. Quests reset every week.
4. Drivers can track progress in real-time.
5. Add flags:
   - questActive
   - questTier
   - ridesCompletedInCycle
   - questBonusEarned

========================================================
B. BOOST ZONE ENGINE (TIME & LOCATION BASED INCENTIVES)
========================================================
Boost Zones increase driver earnings by a percentage based on demand for specific areas and times.

Rules:
1. Create a Boost Zone config using geo-polygons.
2. Boost multipliers:
   - Normal: +10% payout
   - Busy: +20% payout
   - Very Busy: +30% payout
3. Timing windows:
   - Weekdays: 5 PM – 7 PM
   - Weekends: 4 PM – 11 PM
4. Apply boost AFTER dynamic commission but BEFORE final driver payout.
5. Add Boost flags:
   - boostActive
   - boostPercent
   - boostZoneId

========================================================
C. AIRPORT PICKUP BONUSES
========================================================
Apply fixed bonuses for airport pickups.

Airports:
- JFK → +$4 per ride
- LGA → +$3 per ride
- EWR → +$3 per ride

Rules:
1. Trigger only if pickup zone matches airport zones.
2. Add to driver payout directly (not fare).
3. Add flag airportBonusApplied.

========================================================
D. WEATHER BONUS SYSTEM
========================================================
Activate incentives when weather conditions increase driver demand.

Weather triggers:
- Heavy Rain
- Snow
- Storm
- Temperature < 30°F

Bonus:
- +$2 per ride during weather events

Add flags:
- weatherBonusActive
- weatherConditionType

========================================================
E. LATE-NIGHT INCENTIVES
========================================================
Give extra incentives during late-night hours when driver supply is low.

Time window:
12:00 AM – 3:00 AM (every day)

Bonus:
+ $3 per ride

Add flags:
- lateNightBonusApplied

========================================================
F. INTEGRATION RULES (VERY IMPORTANT)
========================================================
1. Incentives must NEVER break minimum driver payout rule.
2. Incentives are added AFTER fare calculation but BEFORE final payout.
3. Incentives NEVER reduce SafeGo’s commission or rider fare.
4. Multiple incentives can stack:
   - Quest Bonus (weekly)
   - Boost Zone Bonus
   - Airport Bonus
   - Weather Bonus
   - Late-Night Bonus
5. Add final driver incentive breakdown:
   - questBonus
   - airportBonus
   - weatherBonus
   - lateNightBonus
   - boostZoneBonus
   - totalIncentivePayout

========================================================
G. UI + BREAKDOWN UPDATES
========================================================
Add a section called “Driver Bonuses” in the driver payout breakdown.

Fields:
- Incentive type
- Bonus amount
- Active flags
- Weekly Quest Progress bar (0–100%)

========================================================
H. TEST CASES (MUST PASS)
========================================================
Create automated tests for:
1. Quest completion tiers
2. Multiple boost zones
3. Airport pickup bonus stacking with boost
4. Weather bonus + late-night bonus combined
5. Incentives not breaking minimum payout
6. Incentives not affecting rider fare
7. Weekly quest reset
8. Multi-incentive stacked payout
9. Correct UI breakdown structure
10. Incentive suppression if config disabled

========================================================
