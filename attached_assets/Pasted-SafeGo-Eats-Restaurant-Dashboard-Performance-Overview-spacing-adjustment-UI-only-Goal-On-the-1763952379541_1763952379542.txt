SafeGo Eats – Restaurant Dashboard “Performance Overview” spacing adjustment (UI only)

Goal:
On the restaurant dashboard (`/restaurant` and `/restaurant/dashboard`), add more vertical space between:
- The search bar, and
- The “Performance Overview” filter tabs (Today / 7 Days / 30 Days)

I want the filter tabs to sit visually lower, about 10–12px further down from the search bar, so the header area can breathe and the layout looks clean.

Very important rules:
- This is a pure UI/layout change.
- Do NOT change any backend logic, API calls, routing, auth, or KYC gating.
- Do NOT change any data fetching or performance calculation.
- Do NOT modify the Online/Offline toggle behavior or design that we just finished.
- Maintain all SafeGuard rules and accessibility.

Implementation details:

1. Target screens
   - `/restaurant`
   - `/restaurant/dashboard`
   - Any shared component that renders the restaurant dashboard “Performance Overview” section.

2. What to change
   - Only adjust the vertical spacing between:
     - Search bar container, and
     - The “Performance Overview” section (the tab bar that shows “Today / 7 Days / 30 Days”).
   - Add a clear visual gap of about 10–12px (enough so it no longer feels attached to the search bar).

3. Suggested approach (Tailwind / CSS)
   - Locate the wrapper/container for the Performance Overview tabs (the element that wraps the three buttons: Today, 7 Days, 30 Days).
   - Add a top margin such as:
     - `mt-3` (12px) or equivalent custom CSS (10–12px).
   - If the tabs are part of a flex layout under the search bar, adjust only the tab-container margin/padding so the rest of the layout remains unchanged.

4. Layout and responsiveness requirements
   - The tabs must remain full-width responsive on:
     - Mobile
     - Tablet
     - Desktop
   - No overlap with the search bar.
   - No extra empty gap above or below the Performance Overview title/cards.
   - No new horizontal scroll should appear on any breakpoint.
   - The cards under Performance Overview (Today’s Orders, Today’s Earnings, Active Orders, etc.) must not shift in a broken way. Just move down together with the tabs if they are grouped.

5. Do NOT do:
   - Do NOT change the typography, labels, or logic of the tabs.
   - Do NOT move the tabs to a different row or under a different section.
   - Do NOT add or remove any filters.
   - Do NOT touch the Online/Offline toggle size, colors, or position in the header.

6. Verification steps (you must run them):
   - Check on mobile viewport (like the screenshot I provided) that:
     - There is a visible 10–12px gap between search bar and the filter tabs.
     - The word “Overview” or “Performance Overview” is not cut off or hidden under the search bar.
   - Check on desktop that spacing is consistent and aligned with the rest of the dashboard.
   - Confirm no extra scrolling or layout glitch has been introduced.

After implementing:
   - Take a screenshot of the updated restaurant dashboard on mobile showing:
     - Search bar
     - The gap
     - “Today / 7 Days / 30 Days” tabs
     - Top part of the cards
   - Confirm in your summary that:
     - Only spacing was changed.
     - No backend or logic was modified.
     - All SafeGuard and KYC rules remain intact.
