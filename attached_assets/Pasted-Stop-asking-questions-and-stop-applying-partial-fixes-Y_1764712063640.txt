Stop asking questions and stop applying partial fixes. You must now run a FULL SYSTEM AUDIT for all Bangladesh customer pages and repair everything in one complete pass.

Authentication fix is NOT enough. You still have broken:
- BD Tickets list (blank page)
- BD Rentals list (“problem loading data” loop)
- BD Shops list (“problem loading data”)
- Category filters not working
- Empty-state missing
- Wrong collection mappings in multiple places
- Shared hooks returning inconsistent data
- Mobile responsive layout issues

You must fix ALL OF THESE TOGETHER, not one by one.

==============================
YOUR MANDATORY OBJECTIVES
==============================

1. Audit every data-loading function used by:
   - /customer/bd-tickets
   - /customer/bd-rentals
   - /customer/bd-shops

2. Verify:
   - Correct collection names used
   - Correct country filter = "BD"
   - Correct status filters (ACTIVE, PUBLISHED, AVAILABLE)
   - Correct token usage
   - No schema mismatches
   - No silent error swallowing

3. Fix ALL UI states properly:
   - loading state
   - true error state
   - empty list state
   - working list render

4. Fix category filters for rentals and shops so they correctly filter by:
   - vehicleType
   - shopCategory (or the existing equivalent)

5. Remove the fake “problem loading data” card from cases where the API is actually successful but empty.

6. Confirm sample/demo data EXISTS for BD so the pages actually show items.

7. After ALL BD marketplace pages work, run a regression audit to ensure:
   - customer home still works
   - ride booking not broken
   - food delivery screens not broken
   - parcel screens not broken
   - driver app unaffected
   - merchant dashboard unaffected
   - admin dashboard still loads all resources

8. DO NOT proceed with small, isolated patches.  
You must complete all corrections in ONE continuous end-to-end implementation.

Deliver a final summary at the end:
- what was broken
- what you fixed
- proof that all pages load with real items
- confirmation of successful regression test
