SafeGo Eats – Restaurant Dashboard layout fix (Performance Overview spacing)

Issue:
On the restaurant dashboard routes, the "Performance Overview" section title is visually colliding with the search bar on mobile. The heading appears inside/under the search bar area instead of clearly starting a new section. This makes the layout feel cramped and hurts readability.

Scope:
• Affects restaurant dashboard layout only.
• Pure layout/spacing fix – do NOT change any business logic, API calls, routing, or KYC/permissions.
• Must comply with all existing SafeGuard rules and responsive guidelines already in the project.

Targets:
• Route: /restaurant
• Route: /restaurant/dashboard (if separate)
• Any shared component that renders the Performance Overview header + period filter tabs (Today / 7 Days / 30 Days).

Required behavior:
1. Section separation
   • The "Performance Overview" heading must be a clearly separated section below the search bar.
   • On all viewports (mobile, tablet, desktop), there must be visible vertical space between:
     – the bottom of the search bar container, and
     – the "Performance Overview" heading row.

2. Spacing specification
   • Add vertical spacing BELOW the search bar container:
     – Mobile (≤ 768px width): margin-bottom or padding-bottom of 24–32px.
     – Tablet (769–1024px): 20–28px.
     – Desktop (> 1024px): 16–24px.
   • The goal is that on a small mobile screen (e.g., 375x812 or similar), the full text "Performance Overview" is fully visible without being clipped by the search bar container.

3. Heading & tabs layout
   • "Performance Overview" should appear as a standalone heading row.
   • The filter tabs (Today / 7 Days / 30 Days) should sit directly under the heading with 8–12px vertical gap.
   • Do NOT place the heading or tabs inside the search bar container.
   • Keep left alignment consistent with the main content area (same left padding as the cards below).

4. No visual overlap
   • Ensure there is NO overlap or clipping between:
     – Search bar,
     – Performance Overview heading,
     – Filter tabs.
   • When scrolling, the layout should feel natural: header → search bar → heading → tabs → cards.

Constraints – do NOT:
• Do NOT change any state logic, online/offline toggle behavior, or data queries.
• Do NOT modify KYC, auth, or permission logic.
• Do NOT rename components or routes.
• Do NOT change typography (font sizes, weights) of the heading or tabs.
• Do NOT introduce horizontal scrolling.

Accessibility & responsiveness:
• Maintain WCAG-friendly contrast and tap areas already defined.
• On mobile:
  – Verify in a narrow viewport that the heading "Performance Overview" is completely visible above the tabs.
  – No part of the text should sit behind or inside the search bar container.
• On desktop and tablet:
  – Spacing should look balanced but slightly tighter than mobile (as specified above).

Verification steps (please perform and self-check):
1. Test on at least:
   – Mobile viewport (around 375x812),
   – Tablet viewport (~768–1024 width),
   – Desktop viewport (>1280 width).
2. On each viewport, confirm:
   – The search bar ends, then there is a clear vertical gap,
   – "Performance Overview" is fully readable and not touching or clipping into the search bar,
   – Tabs (Today / 7 Days / 30 Days) are clearly below the heading with a small gap,
   – The order cards (Today’s Orders, Today’s Earnings, Active Orders, etc.) start below the tabs with consistent spacing.
3. Take a final screenshot of /restaurant (or /restaurant/dashboard) on mobile viewport showing:
   – Search bar,
   – Full "Performance Overview" text,
   – Tabs row,
   – Top of the first metric card.

Reminder:
This task is only a visual layout/spacing adjustment for the Performance Overview section on the restaurant dashboard. Do not touch backend logic, APIs, routing, authentication, or KYC/SafeGuard protections.
