You are continuing the SafeGo admin panel work. This is Step 34 – USA driver profile layout fix.

Goal
Fix the USA Identity Information section for drivers so that:
1) The name uses First / Middle / Last name format instead of a single “Full Legal Name” label.
2) The Emergency Contact section is shown at the very bottom of the USA profile page (after all identity, address, and license document blocks).
Do this without breaking existing data or changing the database schema.

Key requirements

1) Name format (UI only, no schema change)
- Current behavior: The USA Identity Information section shows a single field/label like “Full Legal Name: John Michael Smith”.
- Target behavior:
  - Display the name in three parts:
    • First Name
    • Middle Name
    • Last Name
  - In the read-only view, show three separate labels (First Name, Middle Name, Last Name).
  - In the "Edit USA Profile" form:
    • Replace any single full-name input with three inputs: firstName, middleName, lastName.
    • Middle name can be optional (nullable).
- Backward compatibility (important):
  - DO NOT change the Prisma schema or database structure.
  - Assume the database still stores a single full name field (e.g. fullLegalName).
  - On load:
    • Safely split the existing full name into first/middle/last in the UI only.
    • A simple, safe approach is:
      – If there are 2 parts: first + last.
      – If there are 3 or more parts: first = first word, last = last word, middle = everything in between joined with spaces.
  - On save:
    • Recombine first/middle/last into a single full name string and save back to the existing fullLegalName field.
    • If middle name is empty, only use first + last.

2) Emergency Contact section order
- Current behavior: The Emergency Contact section appears in the middle of the USA profile page (before or between other blocks).
- Target behavior:
  - The USA Identity Information section should follow this order:
    1. Profile Photo
    2. Name fields (First, Middle, Last)
    3. Phone, Date of Birth, License state/number/expiry
    4. SSN block (with masked “Show SSN” button, unchanged)
    5. Residential Address (Street, City, State, ZIP)
    6. DMV License Documents (front, back, expiry)
    7. TLC License (New York only) – front, back, expiry
    8. Emergency Contact – this entire block must be the last section on the page
       • Name
       • Phone
       • Relationship (if already present; if not present, DO NOT add new fields in this step)
- Make sure that moving Emergency Contact to the bottom does not break:
  • Responsive layout
  • Existing styles
  • Any conditional rendering for non-USA drivers (this layout applies only to USA Identity Information).

3) No breaking changes / safety rules
- DO NOT:
  - Change any Prisma schema or database migrations.
  - Remove or relax any existing validation or RBAC protections.
- DO:
  - Keep all existing security behavior, including:
    • Admin-only access to USA driver identity and documents.
    • SSN encryption and masked display as implemented in previous steps.
  - Ensure that:
    • USA drivers without middle name still work.
    • Legacy full names continue to display correctly after the split/rejoin logic.

4) Testing checklist
After implementation, verify the following:

USA driver (non-NY):
- Go to an existing USA driver detail page (/admin/drivers/[id]):
  • Name is displayed as First / Middle / Last (with middle possibly empty).
  • Emergency Contact is visible at the very bottom of the USA Identity Information section.
- Click “Edit USA Profile”:
  • Three name inputs are shown.
  • Saving updates recombines to the same full name field and the name renders correctly in read-only view.
- Confirm there are no console errors and no TypeScript errors in the affected components.

USA New York driver:
- Filter to United States + New York (NY) and open a NY driver.
- Verify the same order as above, with TLC License block before Emergency Contact.
- Confirm that moving Emergency Contact did not break the DMV/TLC document warnings and status messages.

Non-USA drivers:
- Bangladesh driver pages and identity sections must be unchanged by this step.

If everything passes, summarize the exact files you changed (client and server), confirm no schema changes were made, and that the new layout is production-safe and fully backward compatible.
