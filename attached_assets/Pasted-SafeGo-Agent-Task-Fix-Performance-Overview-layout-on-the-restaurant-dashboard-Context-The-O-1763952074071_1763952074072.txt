SafeGo Agent – Task: Fix “Performance Overview” layout on the restaurant dashboard

Context:
- The Online/Offline toggle and the restaurant header are now OK.
- The problem is with the “Performance Overview” row on the restaurant dashboard on mobile.
- On small screens, the “Performance Overview” heading and the date range tabs (Today / 7 Days / 30 Days) are too close to the search bar and look visually cramped, sometimes appearing partially under the search bar.

Goal:
Make the “Performance Overview” section clean, readable, and properly spaced under the search bar on all screen sizes, without changing any backend logic.

Scope:
- Restaurant dashboard main page:
  - `/restaurant`
  - `/restaurant/dashboard` (if this route exists and reuses the same layout)
- Only the “Performance Overview” row and its spacing relative to the search bar.
- Do NOT modify:
  - Online/Offline toggle logic or placement
  - Header structure and KYC/role gating
  - Dashboard cards content or metrics logic

Requirements:

A. Spacing between search bar and Performance Overview
1. After the search bar container, ensure there is clear vertical space before the “Performance Overview” row.
2. Add a margin-top between the bottom of the search bar and the Performance Overview row:
   - Mobile: 16–20px
   - Tablet / Desktop: 20–24px
3. Make sure nothing from the Performance Overview row renders “inside” or under the search bar visually. The search bar is one clear block, then space, then the row with:
   - “Performance Overview” title on the left
   - Date-range tabs (Today / 7 Days / 30 Days) on the right.

B. Performance Overview row layout
1. The first line of this section should be a single row container with:
   - Left: Heading text “Performance Overview”
   - Right: The date-range selector (tabs or segmented control: Today / 7 Days / 30 Days)
2. Implement this row using a responsive flex layout:
   - `display: flex`
   - `align-items: center`
   - `justify-content: space-between`
   - `gap` for spacing between elements
3. On very small screens, the row should be allowed to wrap:
   - `flex-wrap: wrap`
   - When wrapping, the heading stays on the first line, and the date-range tabs go to a second line BELOW the heading with a small top margin (e.g., 8–12px).
4. The heading text must not be truncated:
   - Full text “Performance Overview” visible.
   - No overlap with search bar or date tabs.

C. Typography and alignment
1. Keep existing typography tokens, but ensure:
   - Heading uses the correct heading style (same as other section titles in the dashboard).
   - Date-range tabs remain right-aligned on larger screens.
2. On mobile, when wrapping:
   - Heading is left-aligned.
   - Date-range selector is also left-aligned on its own line, with consistent padding.

D. Sticky / z-index behavior (if search bar is sticky)
1. If the search bar container uses sticky positioning:
   - Ensure the Performance Overview row is below it in stacking order and does not render underneath when scrolling.
   - Fix any z-index or margin issues that cause the title to appear overlapped by the search bar edge.

E. No layout regressions
1. Do not change:
   - Card layout for Today’s Orders, Today’s Earnings, Active Orders, etc.
   - Metrics logic or API calls.
2. Confirm that the same section looks correct on:
   - Mobile (375–430px width)
   - Tablet
   - Desktop
3. The cards should start immediately below the Performance Overview row with consistent vertical spacing (16–24px).

F. Validation steps
1. After implementing, test on:
   - `/restaurant`
   - `/restaurant/dashboard` (if applicable)
2. On each viewport:
   - Scroll from the top and visually confirm:
     - Search bar at top
     - Clear vertical space
     - “Performance Overview” row
     - Then the metrics cards
   - Confirm no text is cut off and nothing overlaps horizontally or vertically.
3. Take a screenshot on mobile width of the top of the dashboard showing:
   - Header
   - Search bar
   - “Performance Overview” + date-range tabs
   - Top of the first card
4. Confirm in your summary:
   - Performance Overview spacing is fixed.
   - No overlap with search bar.
   - No duplicate headers or new regressions.
   - All SafeGuard rules, KYC gating, and backend logic remain unchanged.

This task is strictly a visual / layout refinement for the Performance Overview section on the restaurant dashboard.
