Redesign the "You're receiving orders" control in the restaurant dashboard header to match a capsule-style power button like the reference image:

DESIRED DESIGN

1) General style
   - Single capsule button (no separate label + toggle)
   - Background: solid black (#000000 or near-black)
   - Border-radius: 9999px (fully rounded pill)
   - Horizontal layout: [power icon] [label text]
   - Good padding: e.g. px-4 py-2 on desktop, smaller on mobile
   - Text color: white
   - Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile

2) ONLINE STATE ("Go Online" style like the image)
   - Capsule background: black
   - Left icon:
       • Circular outline with green stroke (#22c55e)
       • Power symbol inside the circle, also green
   - Label text (right side): "Online" or "Receiving orders"
       • Use medium/bold font
   - Optional subtle glow or shadow around the green icon
   - Hover state: slightly brighter green and subtle scale/opacity transition

3) OFFLINE STATE
   - Capsule background: black (same)
   - Left icon:
       • Circular outline with RED stroke (#ef4444)
       • Power symbol inside the circle, also red
   - Label text: "Offline" or "Not receiving orders"
   - Hover state: slightly brighter red

4) BEHAVIOR
   - Clicking the button toggles online/offline state (preserve existing business logic; only change the UI).
   - Keep using the existing field that indicates whether the restaurant is receiving orders.
   - When state changes, button updates color + label immediately.
   - Add smooth transition (200–250ms) for color and icon changes.

5) ACCESSIBILITY
   - Add aria-label reflecting current state, e.g.:
       • "Restaurant is online. Tap to go offline."
       • "Restaurant is offline. Tap to go online."
   - Ensure good contrast for text and icon over black background.

6) IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
   - Create or update a dedicated component, e.g.:
       • client/src/components/restaurant/ReceivingOrdersButton.tsx
   - Use the new capsule button in the restaurant header where "You're receiving orders" toggle currently appears.
   - Do NOT change any backend API, Prisma schema, KYC, RBAC, or existing business logic.
   - Keep the rest of the 3-row header layout as it is (top brand bar, identity row, search row).

7) TESTING
   - Verify ONLINE and OFFLINE states on:
       • Desktop
       • Tablet
       • Mobile
   - Confirm:
       • No layout break in the header
       • Button is clearly visible and clickable
       • Color and text always match the actual state.

After implementing, summarize:
- Which component/file you changed
- Final labels used for online/offline
- Screenshots or description of the button in both states (green and red).
