You are working on the SafeGo project in this Replit.

Issue:
The "System Monitoring" and "Security Threat Center" cards are NOT visible on the /admin dashboard home page, even though:
- The JWT_SECRET is configured and the app is running.
- /api/auth/me returns SUPER_ADMIN with VIEW_DASHBOARD and MANAGE_SECURITY capabilities.
- Your own summary says the cards exist in home.tsx and are gated by VIEW_DASHBOARD.
- I can open the admin home at /admin, but those two cards are missing from the Management section.

Goal:
Make both cards clearly visible again on the /admin dashboard for SUPER_ADMIN users, WITHOUT changing any other security logic.

Detailed requirements:
1. Open the admin dashboard home component (for example client/src/pages/admin/home.tsx or whichever file renders the admin sections).
2. Find the config/array where the Management cards are defined (Notification Center, KYC Approvals, Document Center, Driver Management, Customer Management, Complaints, Wallet Settlement, Activity Log, Global Settings).
3. Confirm that:
   - "System Monitoring" card is present with:
     - title: "System Monitoring"
     - description: "Real-time security monitoring and system health"
     - route: "/admin/monitoring"
     - permission: VIEW_DASHBOARD
   - "Security Threat Center" card is present with:
     - title: "Security Threat Center"
     - description: "Advanced threat detection and real-time incident response"
     - route: "/admin/security-center"
     - permission: VIEW_DASHBOARD
4. If they are missing from that list, add them back into the same Management section as normal cards, AFTER "Wallet Settlement" and BEFORE "Activity Log".
5. If they are already in the list, debug why they are not rendered:
   - Check the map/filter conditions used to render adminSections.
   - Ensure VIEW_DASHBOARD is being checked correctly and not filtered out by any other condition (for example, wrong capability name, typo, or extra filter).
   - Make sure there is no mobile/desktop specific layout that hides these two cards.
6. Do NOT remove or rename any existing cards. Only fix or add the two security cards so they show up.
7. Run the app, open /admin, and VERIFY that:
   - I can see both "System Monitoring" and "Security Threat Center" cards in the Management section.
   - Clicking them correctly navigates to /admin/monitoring and /admin/security-center.
8. Update replit.md briefly describing:
   - What was wrong with the visibility.
   - What you changed to restore the cards.

Complete this fix fully without asking me to choose an option. When you are done, show me a short summary and confirm that the cards are visible.
