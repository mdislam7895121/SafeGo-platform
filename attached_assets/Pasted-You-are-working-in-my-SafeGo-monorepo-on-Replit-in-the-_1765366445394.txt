You are working in my SafeGo monorepo on Replit, in the project currently named “ReplitBackend”.

Goal:
Redesign and polish the SafeGo marketing landing page (the root URL, e.g. https://safegoglobal.com/) so that it:
- Looks and feels as professional as Uber’s marketing site.
- Stays 100% connected to the existing SafeGo backend and app routes.
- Respects region-specific business rules for Bangladesh, United States, and Global.
- Follows basic frontend security and privacy best practices for a public marketing page.

VERY IMPORTANT ARCHITECTURE RULES (DO NOT BREAK):
1. There is a single shared SafeGo backend (pricing, GPS, ride status, country rules).
2. The landing page is ONLY a frontend client. It must NOT create its own pricing, routing, or status logic.
3. All existing app routes like `/ride`, `/drive`, `/delivery`, `/food`, `/parcel`, `/shops`, `/tickets`, `/driver/signup`, `/restaurant/signup`, etc. must keep working exactly as they do now.
4. Do NOT expose any secrets, API keys, tokens, or internal URLs in the landing page code. Use existing public routes only.
5. Do NOT change any backend schemas, Prisma models, or APIs. This task is frontend-only.

FILES / STRUCTURE:
1. Find the main landing page implementation, currently something like:
   - `client/src/pages/landing/LandingPage.tsx`
   - And any related components under `client/src/components/landing/` (Hero, Services, Partner, HowItWorks, Safety, FAQ, Footer, etc.).
2. Before making big changes, create a small comment near the top of the main landing page file explaining:
   - Date
   - What was changed
   - That this is a visual/UX refactor only.

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS (Uber-level professional quality):
1. Overall layout:
   - Keep the existing hero layout (left text, right services card) but refine spacing, typography, and alignment so it looks more premium and balanced on desktop and mobile.
   - Ensure a consistent max-width container and vertical rhythm between sections.
   - Use subtle background gradients, card shadows, and smooth section separation (no harsh borders or random gaps).
   - Keep the existing font choices unless there is a simple and safe way to improve them using system fonts or what is already used by the app.

2. Header / Navigation:
   - Keep the SafeGo logo, region selector (Bangladesh / United States / Global), and main nav items (Ride, Drive, Business, About).
   - Make the header sticky on scroll (if it is not already) so users can always access navigation.
   - Make sure the “Log in” and “Sign up” buttons are clearly visible on desktop and still accessible via a clean menu on mobile.
   - DO NOT change the actual links for Login/Signup – only style them.

3. Region selector + services logic (must respect existing business rules):
   - Bangladesh:
     - Services: Rides, Food Delivery, Parcel Delivery, Local Shops, Tickets & Travel.
     - “Become a partner” section: left card “For Drivers & Couriers”; right card “For Restaurants & Shops”.
   - United States:
     - Services: Rides, Food Delivery, Parcel Delivery. NO “Local Shops”.
     - “Become a partner” section: right card title should be just “For Restaurants”.
   - Global:
     - Same structure as Bangladesh for now, but copy should be generic (no Bangladesh-specific text).
   - Use a simple `REGION_CONFIG` (or improve the existing one) that already drives this behavior. Do NOT hardcode the texts three times – keep it config-driven and easy to extend.

4. Hero section:
   - Keep the main headline concept: “Move, eat, and deliver with SafeGo”.
   - Under the title, have a short, strong, one-line description per region:
     - Bangladesh: emphasize “first launching in Bangladesh” and all-in-one app.
     - United States: emphasize rides + food + parcel, future expansion, and strong compliance.
     - Global: emphasize SafeGo as a global, secure mobility and delivery platform.
   - Primary CTA button (left): “Explore services” pointing to the app landing route for /ride or the correct entry point that already exists. DO NOT invent new URLs.
   - Secondary CTA (text button link): “Become a partner” that scrolls to or navigates to the “Become a partner” section on the same page.

5. Services section:
   - Use clean, consistent cards for each service (Rides, Food Delivery, Parcel Delivery, Local Shops, Tickets & Travel).
   - Each card:
     - Has an icon, title, and 1 short line of text.
     - On hover (desktop) add a very subtle scale/shadow effect.
   - Cards should align in a neat responsive grid (2 columns on small screens, 4/5 on larger screens).
   - Make sure the set of cards respects the region rules described above.

6. “Become a Partner” section:
   - Two cards side by side (on mobile stack them vertically).
   - Left card: “For Drivers & Couriers” (always same content).
   - Right card:
     - Bangladesh / Global: title “For Restaurants & Shops”.
     - United States: title “For Restaurants”.
   - Each card has:
     - A short description.
     - 3–4 bullet points (compact, professional copy – no long paragraphs).
     - A primary button:
       - Drivers: “Start driving” → keep the current internal link to driver signup/onboarding.
       - Restaurants/Shops: “Register your business” → keep the existing restaurant signup link.
   - IMPORTANT: Only update the visual style and text. Do NOT change the actual signup URLs.

7. “How SafeGo Works” section:
   - Turn this into a clear, step-by-step flow grouped by service:
     - Rides
     - Food Delivery
     - Parcel Delivery
   - Use numbered steps and ensure all text is concise and easy to scan.
   - Maintain the existing structure but refine spacing, icons, and typography to match the rest of the page.

8. “Safety & Security” section (very important for cybersecurity positioning):
   - Keep three main columns:
     - “Your safety comes first” (for customers)
     - “Safety while you work” (for drivers & couriers)
     - “Protecting your data” (cybersecurity and privacy)
   - Update the “Protecting your data” column to clearly highlight:
     - HTTPS-only communication across all services.
     - No sharing of personal data with third parties without consent.
     - Regular security reviews and monitoring on the backend (described at a high level only).
   - This is marketing copy, not technical documentation. DO NOT hardcode any internal IPs, domains, or security tool names. Keep it generic but accurate.

9. FAQ / Support section:
   - Use a simple accordion for FAQs, with clean spacing between questions.
   - Keep questions like:
     - How do I request a SafeGo ride?
     - When is SafeGo launching in Bangladesh?
     - How do I become a driver or courier?
     - What payment methods are accepted?
     - How is my safety ensured?
   - Make sure the content is region-neutral where necessary (for example, you can mention “launching first in Bangladesh” only when the selected region is Bangladesh).

10. Final CTA + Footer:
   - Final CTA should have two options:
     - “Download the app” (for future app store links – keep it as a placeholder button with no external link yet or a simple `#` anchor).
     - “Become a partner” (scrolls to the partner section or uses existing navigation).
   - Footer:
     - Keep company links: About us, Careers, Press, Blog.
     - Services links: Ride, Food, Parcel, Shops (only show Shops link if supported by the region, but you can keep the link list simple and static for now if dynamic is too complex).
     - Partners: Drive with us, Deliver with us, Restaurant partners, Shop partners.
     - Support: FAQ, Safety, Contact, Help Center (or similar).

FRONTEND SECURITY & PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS (for this page):
1. No inline `<script>` tags or inline `onClick="..."` handlers in raw HTML. Use React/TypeScript event handlers only.
2. Do not introduce any analytics SDKs, tracking scripts, or third-party embeds in this task.
3. Do not fetch any personal data on this landing page. It is a public, unauthenticated marketing page.
4. Ensure all external links (if any are used) open safely:
   - Use `rel="noopener noreferrer"` when using `target="_blank"`.
5. Do not log any sensitive info to the browser console.
6. The landing page should remain fully functional even if JavaScript errors are thrown elsewhere in the app – keep it as simple and robust as possible.

RESPONSIVE DESIGN:
1. Test and adjust layout for:
   - Small mobile screens
   - Tablets
   - Standard laptop/desktop width
2. Make sure:
   - Hero text does not wrap in an ugly way on mobile.
   - Service cards stay readable (2-per-row or full-width).
   - Partner and safety sections stack cleanly with enough spacing.
3. Avoid horizontal scrolling at all breakpoints.

AFTER IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Run the dev server and visually check:
   - Bangladesh region: shows 5 services (including Local Shops, Tickets & Travel) and “For Restaurants & Shops” in the partner section.
   - United States region: shows only Rides, Food Delivery, Parcel Delivery and partner section right card as “For Restaurants”.
   - Global region: content is generic and shows all core services.
2. Confirm that:
   - All CTAs (Explore services, Become a partner, Start driving, Register your business) still navigate to the correct app routes that already existed.
   - There are no TypeScript errors or obvious console errors related to the landing page.
3. Once everything looks correct, clean up any commented-out experimental code you might have added.

Finally, summarize exactly what you changed (files touched, high-level visual improvements, and any config changes), and confirm that:
- All region rules are respected.
- No backend logic or routes were modified.
- No secrets or sensitive data are exposed in the landing page.
