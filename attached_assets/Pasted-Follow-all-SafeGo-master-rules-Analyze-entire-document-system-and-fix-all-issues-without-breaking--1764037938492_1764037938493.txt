Follow all SafeGo master rules. 
Analyze entire document system and fix all issues without breaking any existing customer/driver/restaurant/admin flow. Complete the full Driver Document Management System (D7) in one continuous implementation.

Required final output:

1. DRIVER DOCUMENT CENTER
- Implement full driver document page with checklists, statuses (pending/under_review/approved/rejected), upload and re-upload options, file validations, size/type limits, and secure token handling.
- Required documents: profile_photo, driver_license, insurance_doc, car_registration, vehicle_inspection, tlc_license (NY only), license_plate_number only (NO license plate image), NO social_security_upload.
- Integrate document progress into driver KYC status.
- Fix all upload errors: “unexpected field”, “access token required”, “cannot read properties of null (reading 'json')”.

2. ADMIN DOCUMENT VERIFICATION
- Build complete admin doc verification center.
- View documents by driver, filter by status, sort by country.
- Add Approve/Reject with required reason for rejection.
- Auto-update driver KYC state after admin action.
- Trigger driver notifications after approval/rejection.

3. BACKEND API STANDARDIZATION
- Fix all document upload handlers.
- Standardize API JSON responses with success:true/false format.
- Secure all endpoints with proper token validation.
- Ensure zero breakage to existing KYC, vehicle system, promotions, payouts, restaurant, or customer flows.

4. UI/UX REQUIREMENTS
- Build modern, clean document center UI.
- Add preview modal for uploaded documents.
- Add progress bar for uploads.
- Ensure full mobile responsive behavior.

5. SYSTEM-WIDE SAFETY CHECKS
- Ensure no breaking schema changes unless strictly necessary.
- Validate migration backward compatibility.
- Test all flows: driver upload, admin verify, driver see updated status.

Complete all of D7 fully in one implementation.
