TASK: Fix the Shop Partner onboarding flow AND enable full demo access for BD customers.

Follow SafeGo Master Rules.

──────────────────────────
PROBLEM SUMMARY
──────────────────────────
- /shop-partner/setup shows blank loading page.
- User can become "shop_partner" without completing Step 1.
- Step 2 submit throws validation errors because all required fields from Step 1 are missing.
- On reload, Step 1 form data is lost.
- Customer accounts cannot see BD demo content (tickets, rentals, shops).

REQUIRED FIXES (Implement all)
──────────────────────────

1. FRONTEND FIX — SHOP PARTNER ONBOARDING (BD)
Implement full 3-step wizard with persistent form state:
- Step 1: Owner & Identity info (all mandatory BD KYC fields)
- Step 2: Delivery settings
- Step 3: Shop details & confirmation

Rules:
- User cannot go to Step 2 unless Step 1 is fully valid.
- User cannot submit Step 3 unless Step 1 & 2 stored in state.
- If setup is incomplete, redirect ALWAYS to Step 1.
- If setup is complete, redirect to shop dashboard (/shop-partner/dashboard).
- Store wizard state in localStorage or global store so reload never loses data.

2. BACKEND FIX — SHOP PARTNER VALIDATION
Implement combined payload validation:
{
  shopName,
  shopType,
  shopAddress,
  ownerName,
  fatherName,
  dateOfBirth,
  presentAddress,
  permanentAddress,
  nidNumber,
  emergencyContactName,
  emergencyContactPhone,
  deliveryRadius,
  prepTime,
  countryCode: "BD"
}

- Reject if ANY required field missing.
- Return clean human-readable errors in Bangla.

3. ROUTING FIX
- If user is shop_partner but NOT verified:
    always redirect to onboarding.
- If user is verified:
    route to dashboard.
- Do not auto-route to Step 2 or Step 3 without Step 1 completion.

4. ADMIN FIX
- Admin should see shop_partner accounts as Pending KYC until Step 1–3 saved.

5. CUSTOMER DEMO UNLOCK (BD)
Enable full BD demo for customer role:
- BD rentals list must show sample vehicles (car, microbus, tourist bus).
- BD shops must show at least 6 demo shops with demo items.
- BD tickets must show demo routes and demo buses.
- Customer should be able to browse everything without any operator approval.

6. QA TEST CASES (Agent must verify)
- Fresh user signup as shop_partner should land on Step 1 always.
- Reload during Step 2 keeps Step 1 data.
- Submitting Step 2 without Step 1 should be impossible.
- Customer login (BD) should show:
    * Ride + Eats + Parcel + BD Rentals + BD Shops + BD Tickets
- No blank screens anywhere.
