You are working inside my original SafeGo project in my personal Replit account.

Your ONLY job in this session is:

1) Push this existing project to a new GitHub repository.
2) Do NOT redesign, refactor, or reorganize any code.
3) Do NOT split files, rename files, or change any business logic.
4) Only run the minimum git commands required to connect and push to GitHub.

Concrete steps:

1. Check whether this directory is already a git repo:
   - Run: `git status`
2. If it is NOT a git repo, then:
   - Run: `git init`
   - Create or update a proper `.gitignore` so that `node_modules`, build output, and Replit cache files are NOT tracked.
3. Prepare a single initial commit that contains the current state of the project WITHOUT modifying any app code, configs, or folder structure.
4. If you can automatically create a GitHub repository using Replit’s GitHub integration, create one named `safego-platform` under my GitHub account. 
   - If you cannot create it automatically, STOP and clearly tell me: 
     "Please create an empty GitHub repo named `safego-platform` and give me the HTTPS URL. I will continue after you provide it."
5. Once the remote repository exists, configure git:
   - Set the default branch to `main` if needed.
   - Add the remote origin using the GitHub HTTPS URL.
   - Commit all existing files with a message like: `Initial SafeGo project import from Replit`.
   - Push the code to the `main` branch.
6. At the end, print a very clear summary with:
   - The exact GitHub repository URL.
   - The current git remote configuration (`git remote -v`).
   - The current branch name.
   - Confirmation that NO source code files were changed.

Important rules:

- Do NOT touch the application code, routing, landing page layout, or any backend logic.
- Do NOT try to "optimize" memory, split the landing page, or change architecture.
- If any operation would modify existing source files, STOP and ask for my permission first.
- If authentication with GitHub is required, clearly tell me what I need to click or approve in the UI.

After the repository has been pushed successfully and you have shown me the GitHub URL and summary, STOP. Do not continue with any extra improvements or new features.
