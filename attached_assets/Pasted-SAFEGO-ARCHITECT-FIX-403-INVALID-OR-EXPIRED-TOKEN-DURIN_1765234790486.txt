SAFEGO ARCHITECT – FIX 403 “INVALID OR EXPIRED TOKEN” DURING RESTAURANT REGISTRATION

You must fix the authentication/token validation flow for the restaurant onboarding submit action.  
The user received this error:

403: {"error":"invalid or expired token"}

This means the frontend submission request is NOT sending a valid Authorization header, OR the backend is rejecting a valid user session due to a missing/incorrect token flow.

=====================================================
A) SAFEGO MASTER RULES (DO NOT BREAK)

Keep all SafeGo rules intact:
- Roles: customer, driver, restaurant, admin (strict separation)
- All onboarding flows
- All country-specific KYC
- All collections (rides, food_orders, deliveries)
- All commission & wallet logic
- All status flows
- All security rules
- DO NOT rename or delete DB fields
- DO NOT change API signatures or break existing users

=====================================================
B) ROOT CAUSE TO FIX  
One or more of the following is happening:

1) The restaurant registration form is being submitted WITHOUT an Authorization header.
2) The Authorization header is using a null/undefined token.
3) The login session cookie is not being applied during onboarding.
4) The backend handler for restaurant registration requires a role token but the frontend isn't providing one.
5) The backend is validating the wrong role (driver/customer) instead of restaurant partner onboarding.
6) The client-side fetch/axios call is missing:
   Authorization: Bearer <valid_token>
7) Token refresh logic (if implemented) is not being triggered.

=====================================================
C) REQUIRED ACTIONS

You must systematically fix the issue in **three layers**:

--------------------------------------------------
1) FRONTEND FIX  
Locate the restaurant registration submit handler in the canonical registration component at:  
`/partner/restaurant/register`

Ensure the submission request includes:

- If token is stored in localStorage:
  ```js
  const token = localStorage.getItem("token");
  fetch("/api/restaurant/register", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "Authorization": token ? `Bearer ${token}` : "",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(payload),
  });
