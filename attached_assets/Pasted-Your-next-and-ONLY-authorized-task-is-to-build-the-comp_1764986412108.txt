Your next and ONLY authorized task is to build the complete Customer-Facing Parcel Request Page for SafeGo. This must follow ALL SafeGo Master Rules, Security Rules, Role Isolation Rules, BD/US KYC Rules, Commission Logic, and Non-Breaking Architecture requirements.

You must NOT modify or rename any existing parcel backend logic. Only integrate UI/UX on top of the existing parcel engine.

=====================================================
PHASE 1 — PAGE STRUCTURE (Customer App Only)
=====================================================
Build a new customer screen named:
   ParcelRequestPage

It must include:

1. Parcel Type Selector
   - Domestic (Bangladesh)
   - International

2. Pickup Details
   - Pickup address (autocomplete + map picker)
   - Pickup geo coordinates
   - Optional: "Pickup Now" or "Schedule Pickup"

3. Dropoff Details
   Domestic:
       - Dropoff address (autocomplete)
       - Dropoff geo
   International:
       - Destination country dropdown
       - City name field

4. Parcel Weight Section
   - Actual weight (kg)
   - Dimensions (L × W × H)
   - Auto-compute volumetric weight
   - Highlight which one is chargeable

5. Delivery Speed Selector
   - Regular
   - Quick
   - Express
   - Super Express

6. Parcel Options
   - Fragile item toggle
   - Cash-on-Delivery toggle (Domestic only)
   - COD amount input (if enabled)

=====================================================
PHASE 2 — LIVE PRICING ENGINE (Frontend)
=====================================================
Integrate the backend calculation API:
   POST /api/parcel/bd/request
   POST /api/parcel/int/request (if exists)
   OR use pricing endpoint if available.

Show a real-time pricing card:
   - Base delivery charge
   - Speed surcharge
   - Fragile surcharge
   - COD fee
   - Fuel surcharge (international)
   - Remote area surcharge
   - Final Total

All values must update instantly when user edits any input.

=====================================================
PHASE 3 — PLACE ORDER FLOW
=====================================================
Add “Confirm Parcel Request” button.

On press:
- Validate BD KYC (date of birth, address, NID for BD)
- Validate US KYC if customer is in US
- Handle missing fields with safe error messages
- Create parcel delivery request via backend
- Redirect customer to:
        Parcel Tracking Page

=====================================================
PHASE 4 — PARCEL TRACKING PAGE (Customer)
=====================================================
Create a new screen:
   ParcelTrackingPage

Must display:
- Parcel status:
     requested
     searching_driver

     picked_up
     on_the_way
     delivered
     cancelled_x
- Driver details (only name + phone, NOT documents)
- Live map tracking (driver-to-dropoff)

=====================================================
- Customer cannot view driver license or ID.
- Customer cannot modify driver location.
- Admin cannot override customer parcel UI.
- Restaurant partners cannot access parcel pages.

=====================================================
PHASE 6 — RESPONSIVE UI REQUIREMENTS
=====================================================
The Parcel Request Page must work perfectly on:
- Mobile portrait
- Mobile landscape
- Tablet
- Desktop web

Ensure no overflowing layout, broken map, or missing fields.

=====================================================
PHASE 7 — QA VALIDATION
=====================================================
Before marking complete, test:
1. Domestic parcel request
2. International parcel request
3. Pickup scheduling
4. COD flow
5. Live pricing accuracy
6. Status updates reflected real-time
7. Driver assignment works
