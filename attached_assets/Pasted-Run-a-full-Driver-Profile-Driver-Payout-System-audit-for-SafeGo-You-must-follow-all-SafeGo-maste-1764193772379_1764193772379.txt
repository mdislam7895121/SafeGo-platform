Run a full Driver Profile + Driver Payout System audit for SafeGo.

You must follow all SafeGo master rules, keep all existing security layers (KYC, RBAC, OTP/2FA, encryption, audit logs, rate-limits) untouched, and perform a deep architectural check to ensure nothing is missing or inconsistent.

Goal:
Fix the specific missing fields AND detect any additional profile/payout inconsistencies.

Already identified issues to fix:
1. Driver personal profile (/driver/profile)
   - Missing Date of Birth field
   - Missing Phone Number field

2. Driver payout setup
   - Missing Account Type dropdown for BANK payouts (Checking/Savings/Other)

Your tasks:
A) Fix the above three issues completely across:
   - UI pages
   - TypeScript interfaces
   - Database models
   - API request/response DTOs
   - Validation layers (Zod/Yup/server validation)
   - Encryption for sensitive fields where applicable
   - Driver-side RBAC rules

B) Perform a FULL audit on all connected systems:
   - driverProfile model
   - driverKYC model
   - unifiedPayout model (shared)
   - payout method creation/update flows
   - server/routes for profile & payout
   - client/src/pages/driver/profile
   - client/src/pages/driver/wallet + payout-methods
   - any consistency between GET and PUT endpoints

Look for:
- hidden fields that exist in the model but not in UI
- fields shown in UI but not persisted correctly
- missing validation rules
- inconsistent naming between DB/model/DTO/UI
- fields stored in one model and forgotten in the other
- mismatched data types
- missing sensitive-field encryption
- missing KYC sync between driver profile and payout
- missing migration defaults that could break existing rows

C) If you find any additional issues (even if not requested), FIX THEM —
but only if they are directly related to:
- driver profile
- driver phone identity
- DOB identity
- payout method setup
- payout verification logic
Do NOT add any new features outside these scopes.

D) After completing fixes:
   - Apply database migrations safely (non-breaking)
   - Restart Start application
   - Run the architect review
   - Confirm that all UI pages load successfully
   - Confirm data saves and persists correctly
   - Confirm RBAC still protects all driver routes
   - Provide screenshots of each updated page

E) Final deliverables:
   - Clean working Driver Profile with DOB + phone
   - Updated Driver Payout form with Account Type
   - Confirmation that NO further missing fields or inconsistencies remain
   - Updated replit.md with a short summary of the audit and fixes

Everything must be implemented professionally with production stability like Uber.
