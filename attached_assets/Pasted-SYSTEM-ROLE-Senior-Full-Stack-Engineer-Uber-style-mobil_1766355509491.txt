SYSTEM ROLE: Senior Full-Stack Engineer (Uber-style mobility platform)

PROJECT: SafeGo Global

GOAL:
Make SafeGo production-ready by fixing all broken pages, moving legal + landing control into Admin, cleaning Google Maps UI, restoring “You Saved” pricing transparency, fixing partner onboarding errors, and preparing the site for Google Search Console.

STRICT RULES:
- Do NOT break any existing working flow
- Do NOT hardcode policy text
- All content must be admin-editable
- Web-first (no native apps)
- Follow steps in order
- Every step must be verifiable in UI

========================
STEP 1 — FIX ALL 404 PAGES (CRITICAL)
========================
Problem:
The following routes return 404:
/terms
/privacy
/cookies
/safety
/data-deletion
/partner-terms
/careers
/restaurant/onboarding

Tasks:
1. Register all routes in the frontend router.
2. Each route must render a real page component (not placeholder).
3. Footer links must correctly open these pages.
4. No route should ever show “Did you forget to add the page to the router?”

Acceptance:
- Clicking any footer or company link never shows 404.

========================
STEP 2 — ADMIN-CONTROLLED LEGAL PAGES
========================
Goal:
All legal/policy pages must be editable from Admin Panel.

Tasks:
1. Create Admin module: “Legal & Policies”.
2. Store each policy in DB with:
   - slug
   - title
   - content (rich text)
   - country (US | BD | GLOBAL)
   - status (draft | published)
3. Frontend legal pages must fetch content via API.
4. Admin changes must reflect instantly on the website.

Acceptance:
- Editing policy in Admin updates live site without code changes.

========================
STEP 3 — GOOGLE SEARCH CONSOLE READY
========================
Tasks:
1. Add robots.txt
2. Add auto-generated sitemap.xml
3. Include all landing + legal pages in sitemap
4. Add SEO meta tags (title, description, canonical)

Acceptance:
- Site is ready for Google Search Console submission.

========================
STEP 4 — GOOGLE MAPS UI CLEANUP (UBER-STYLE)
========================
Problems:
- Red roads are visually noisy
- Map looks cluttered

Tasks:
1. Apply Google Maps custom style:
   - Hide transit labels
   - Desaturate roads
   - No traffic layer
   - Neutral grey roads
2. Preserve:
   - Green pickup marker (custom pin)
   - Red dropoff marker (custom pin)
   - Blue route polyline with white outline
3. Apply only to ride booking map components.

Acceptance:
- Calm, professional, Uber-like map appearance.

========================
STEP 5 — RESTORE “YOU SAVED” VISIBILITY
========================
Problem:
Customer no longer sees savings (e.g. “You saved 10”).

Tasks:
1. Update fare breakdown UI:
   - Base fare
   - Distance fare
   - Time fare
   - Discount
   - YOU SAVED
2. Show “You saved X” on:
   - Vehicle card
   - Fare details modal
3. Do NOT expose internal commission percentages.

Acceptance:
- Customer clearly sees savings like Uber.

========================
STEP 6 — FIX PARTNER / DRIVER ONBOARDING ERRORS
========================
Problem:
Invalid enum errors during onboarding.

Tasks:
1. Sync backend enums:
   - ride_driver
   - delivery_driver
   - shop_partner
   - restaurant
   - ticket_operator
2. Fix frontend payloads to match enums.
3. Ensure flows work:
   - Apply as Driver
   - Start Delivering
   - Restaurant Partner

Acceptance:
- No red error box.
- Onboarding always starts correctly.

========================
STEP 7 — FULLY ADMIN-CONTROLLED LANDING PAGE
========================
Tasks:
1. Admin module: “Landing Page Manager”.
2. Admin can control:
   - Hero text
   - CTA buttons
   - Section visibility
   - “Coming Soon” labels
3. Frontend landing page must render from API only.

Acceptance:
- Owner can edit landing page without developer.

========================
FINAL CHECKLIST (MUST CONFIRM ALL)
========================
- No 404 pages
- Admin controls all policies
- Google Search ready
- Clean Google Maps UI
- “You Saved” visible
- Partner onboarding fixed
- Landing page fully admin-driven

END OF TASK.
