ROLE: You are acting as a Senior Release Engineer + Security Gatekeeper.
This is the FINAL production readiness and deployment task for the SafeGo platform.

ABSOLUTE RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
- Do NOT ask questions
- Do NOT add new features
- Do NOT refactor unrelated code
- Do NOT change any already verified logic
- Do NOT assume anything — verify everything
- If something is broken, FIX it and SHOW PROOF

CURRENT VERIFIED STATE (MUST REMAIN INTACT):
- Environment Guard enforces production secrets
- App exits with code 1 if any required secret is missing
- JWT authentication active
- Session security active
- Single shared database connection only
- Google Maps uses singleton loader, retry logic, cleanup
- Parcel request prop mismatch already fixed
- Rate limiting enabled
- Security headers enabled
- WAF layer enabled

TASK OBJECTIVES:

1) FINAL SYSTEM AUDIT
Perform a full end-to-end audit of:
- Customer Ride flow
- Customer Eats flow
- Customer Parcel flow
- Admin health endpoints
- Database connectivity
- Session persistence
- API error handling
- UI empty-state handling

Check BOTH frontend and backend.
Nothing is allowed to silently fail.

2) PRODUCTION SECRET VALIDATION
Confirm ALL of the following exist and meet requirements:
- JWT_SECRET (minimum 32 characters)
- ENCRYPTION_KEY (64 hex characters)
- SESSION_SECRET (minimum 32 characters)
- DATABASE_URL (valid PostgreSQL connection string)
- GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY (valid and enabled)

Rules:
- No hardcoded secrets
- No fallback values
- No logging secret values
- Production MUST fail fast if any secret is missing

Show startup log proof that validation is enforced.

3) DEPLOYMENT CONFIGURATION
Ensure production uses:
- NODE_ENV=production
- npm run build (production build)
- npm run start (no dev server, no hot reload)

Confirm:
- No Vite dev server in production
- No debug logs exposed
- No stack traces leaked to client
- CORS restricted
- Rate limit thresholds sane

4) SMOKE TESTS (MANDATORY)
Run and verify:

Frontend:
- /customer/ride loads correctly
- /customer/eats loads correctly
- /customer/parcel loads correctly
- No blank screens
- Proper empty-state UI where data is missing

Backend:
- Health endpoint returns OK
- Database queries succeed
- Sessions persist correctly
- JWT auth works as expected

5) ROLLBACK SAFETY
Verify:
- Last checkpoint is valid
- Rollback restores a working state
- No schema drift without migration

6) FINAL RESPONSE FORMAT (STRICT)
Your FINAL reply must be EXACTLY in this format:

🚀 DEPLOYMENT STATUS
READY FOR PRODUCTION ✅
or
BLOCKED ❌ (with exact blocking reason)

🔐 SECRETS CHECK
All required secrets validated

🧪 SMOKE TEST RESULTS
Ride: PASS / FAIL
Eats: PASS / FAIL
Parcel: PASS / FAIL

🛡️ SECURITY STATUS
All protections active

📌 FINAL NOTE
One short sentence only.

NO EXTRA TEXT.
NO EXPLANATIONS.
NO QUESTIONS.

This is a production release, not a sandbox.
