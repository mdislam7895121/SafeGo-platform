You are not allowed to respond with explanations, assumptions, or partial fixes.

This is a FINAL, ONE-SHOT task.
No follow-up, no iteration, no “already fixed” claims without proof.

========================
MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS
========================

1. ENVIRONMENT ENFORCEMENT (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
------------------------------------------
- In PRODUCTION:
  - App MUST FAIL TO START if ANY of the following are missing:
    JWT_SECRET
    ENCRYPTION_KEY
    SESSION_SECRET
    DATABASE_URL
    GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY
- No temp keys.
- No fallback.
- No “optional” logic.
- Exit code must be 1.
- Console must clearly show which key is missing.

- In DEVELOPMENT:
  - App may start WITH WARNINGS ONLY.
  - Warnings must be explicit and visible in logs.

You must VERIFY this by showing actual startup logs for BOTH modes.

2. GOOGLE MAPS – VISUAL STABILITY (CRITICAL)
--------------------------------------------
The map must meet ALL of the following or the task is FAILED:

- No broken tiles
- No half-rendered grid
- No blank squares after:
  - page load
  - tab switch
  - resize
  - mobile/desktop toggle
- ResizeObserver MUST trigger:
  google.maps.event.trigger(map, 'resize')
- Map instance must be singleton
- All listeners, observers, markers MUST be cleaned on unmount
- Retry logic must FULLY reload SDK if script load fails

You must prove this with:
- Browser console logs
- A visible working map screenshot
- Confirmation that tiles remain stable after resize

3. SECRETS VISIBILITY & CONSISTENCY
-----------------------------------
- Secrets must be read from ONE source only
- No duplicate naming
- No mismatch between docs, code, and runtime
- Provide a final list of REQUIRED secrets for production
- Provide a final list of OPTIONAL secrets (if any)

4. FINAL VERIFICATION CHECKLIST (MANDATORY)
-------------------------------------------
Before you mark the task complete, you MUST show:

- [ ] Production start FAILS if any required secret is missing
- [ ] Development start PASSES with warnings only
- [ ] Google Map renders correctly on first load
- [ ] Google Map survives resize without breaking
- [ ] No duplicate Google Maps script tags
- [ ] No memory leaks from observers or listeners

If ANY item is unchecked, DO NOT mark complete.

5. OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT)
-------------------------
Your final response must contain ONLY:

A) Files changed (exact paths)
B) What was enforced (bullet list)
C) Proof logs (code blocks)
D) Final confirmation:
   "READY FOR PRODUCTION – NO BLOCKERS"

No storytelling.
No task history.
No assumptions.
No “should be”.

If this is not done perfectly, the task is considered FAILED.
