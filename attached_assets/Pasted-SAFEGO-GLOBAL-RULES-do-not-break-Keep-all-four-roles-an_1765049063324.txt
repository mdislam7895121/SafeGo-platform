SAFEGO GLOBAL RULES (do not break):

- Keep all four roles and permissions unchanged: Customer, Driver, Restaurant, Admin.
- Do NOT touch KYC logic, country rules, wallets, rides/food_orders/deliveries collections, or commission logic.
- Do NOT rename or remove any API route, DB field, or existing page. Only ADD or refine UI components.
- Admin panel must stay fully functional for verifying customers/drivers/restaurants and managing payouts, balances, and KYC.

TASK: Fix the UX and hover behavior in the Admin "Promotions Center" without breaking any existing SafeGo logic.

1) Back Navigation from Promotions Center
- In the Promotions Center header, add a clear back navigation:
  - A left-aligned back button: arrow icon + label “Back to Dashboard”
  - Or a breadcrumb: Dashboard / Promotions Center
- Default behavior: go to the main admin dashboard route (/admin or the existing dashboard route).
- If router history is available, it is acceptable to use “back” to return to the previous admin page.
- Make sure the back button is visible and usable on both desktop and mobile.

2) Prevent page shaking when hovering promotion cards
- For all promotion tiles (Driver Promotions, Ride Promotions, Referral Bonuses, Opportunity Bonuses) and the Quick Stats cards below:
  - Hover must NOT change the layout box model.
  - DO NOT change width, height, margin, padding, or border-width on hover.
  - Glow and lift must be done only using transform and box-shadow.

- Implement this hover pattern for every card:

  Base state:
    - Same width/height for all cards.
    - min-height set so all cards in a row have identical height.
    - display: flex or grid so content is vertically centered and stable.

  Hover state:
    - Use:
        transform: translateY(-3px) scale(1.01);
        box-shadow:
          0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.05),
          0 12px 32px rgba(140,92,255,0.35),
          0 0 28px rgba(120,70,255,0.45);
    - Add:
        transition: transform 0.25s ease, box-shadow 0.25s ease;
        will-change: transform;

- The purple glow / edge effect must be implemented using absolutely positioned pseudo-elements so it does not affect layout:

  .promo-card::before {
    content: "";
    position: absolute;
    inset: -2px;
    border-radius: inherit;
    background: linear-gradient(
      135deg,
      rgba(255,255,255,0.0),
      rgba(255,255,255,0.55),
      rgba(255,255,255,0.0)
    );
    pointer-events: none;
  }

3) Apply the same stable hover behavior to:
   - Promotion type tiles
   - Quick Stats cards in the Promotions Center
   - Any new promo cards added later

4) Scroll / jitter fix:
   - Ensure the page does not “jump” or “shake” when hovering between cards.
   - If needed, keep the vertical scrollbar always visible (overflow-y: scroll on the main container) so hover does not toggle the scrollbar.

5) Testing:
   - Test Promotions Center on desktop and laptop resolutions.
   - Rapidly move the mouse across all cards: the content must stay stable, no shaking.
   - Confirm that the new Back to Dashboard control works reliably and does not affect other SafeGo routes.

Goal:
Keep the existing purple hover glow on the card you touch, but make the layout fully stable (no page shaking) and add a clear back navigation so admins can return from Promotions Center to the main dashboard easily.
