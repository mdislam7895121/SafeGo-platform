You are the lead architect and senior full-stack engineer for my SafeGo global super-app. The codebase is already production-ready. Do NOT rewrite existing logic or break any working flows. Make only minimal, incremental changes.

Context:
- Stack: Node.js + Express, Prisma + PostgreSQL (Neon), React + TypeScript + Vite, TanStack Query, shadcn/ui.
- Roles: customer, driver, restaurant, admin.
- Status:
  - Authentication, KYC, rides/food/parcel flows, driver management, restaurant management, complaints, and wallet settlement are already working.
  - Admin dashboard shows total users, total drivers, active drivers, restaurants, pending KYC, etc.
  - There is NO dedicated Customer Management page yet.

Goal:
Implement a simple but reliable Customer Management area for the admin, without breaking any existing flows.

Requirements:

1) Admin Customers Card & Navigation
- On the admin dashboard, add a clear “Customers” card/metric under Platform Overview:
  - Display total number of customers (not drivers/restaurants).
- Make this “Customers” card clickable.
- Clicking it should navigate to a new admin page, e.g. `/admin/customers`, protected by the existing admin ProtectedRoute.

2) Customer List Page (`/admin/customers`)
- Implement a customer list similar in style to the driver list, but simpler:
  - Columns:
    - email
    - country
    - KYC status (pending / verified / rejected)
    - account status (active / suspended / blocked)
    - basic usage stats if easily available (e.g. total rides, total food orders, total parcels).
- Since the number of customers for now is small, you can:
  - load them in one request (no complex pagination required),
  - add a simple text search by email,
  - optional quick filters: All / Active / Suspended / Blocked.
- Use Prisma to query `User` + `CustomerProfile` (or equivalent) so that only customer accounts are returned (exclude drivers/restaurants/admin).

3) Customer Details View
- Each row should have a “View” or “Manage” button that opens a customer details view (page or drawer).
- In the details view, show:
  - account info: email, country, createdAt
  - KYC info and current verification status
  - account status (active / suspended / blocked)
  - high-level statistics (if already modeled), such as:
    - number of completed rides
    - number of food orders
    - number of parcels sent
  - DO NOT introduce new tables for stats if not necessary – reuse existing relations or simple aggregate queries only if they already exist.

4) Admin Actions on Customers
- From the details view, allow the admin to:
  - Suspend / Unsuspend customer
  - Block / Unblock customer (harder restriction than suspend)
- Reuse the same backend patterns used for driver suspend/block, including:
  - dedicated PATCH endpoints for updating customer status,
  - appropriate fields on the customer profile or user model,
  - return the updated customer object so the UI stays in sync without a full reload.
- After an action, update the dashboard counts and list views using existing TanStack Query invalidation (no manual window reload).

5) Integration with KYC & Complaints
- Ensure that:
  - Customer KYC entries already shown on `/admin/kyc` remain working.
  - The “Pending KYC” tile on the dashboard includes customers as before (no regression).
- If complaints already support identifying which user is involved, ensure that:
  - complaints against customers (if any) still appear on `/admin/complaints`,
  - the complaints list can indicate if the subject is a driver or a customer (reusing the same approach used for driver/restaurant).

6) Security Phase – RBAC and Safety
- Apply strict admin-only access for:
  - `/admin/customers` route,
  - all new customer-related API endpoints (list, details, suspend/block).
- Use existing auth middleware / role checks; do not create new ad-hoc mechanisms.
- Validate IDs and payloads on all new endpoints.
- Do NOT leak personal data outside the admin scope. Only admins can see full customer information; customers cannot see each other.

7) Non-breaking Changes
- Do NOT change or break:
  - customer login or main app flows,
  - driver management,
  - restaurant management,
  - wallet settlement, rides, or KYC logic.
- If you refactor any shared component or hook for reuse, keep it backward-compatible and add a short code comment describing the change.

8) Testing
- Perform end-to-end tests and summarize:
  - admin can see the Customers card and navigate to `/admin/customers`,
  - customers list loads correctly with real data,
  - admin can open a customer details view,
  - suspend/unsuspend and block/unblock actions work and reflect on all relevant screens,
  - dashboard metrics update correctly,
  - no regression in existing driver, restaurant, KYC, complaints, or wallet flows.

Finally, provide a summary:
- files changed (backend + frontend),
- new API endpoints,
- how an admin can use the Customer Management page in normal daily operations.
