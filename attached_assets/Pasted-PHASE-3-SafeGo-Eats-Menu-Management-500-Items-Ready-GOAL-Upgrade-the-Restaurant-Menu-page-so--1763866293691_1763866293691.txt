PHASE 3 – SafeGo Eats Menu Management (500+ Items Ready)

GOAL:
Upgrade the Restaurant Menu page so a restaurant can manage large menus (minimum 500 items) efficiently.

SCOPE:
- Restaurant Menu route/page only.
- No DB schema changes.
- Must remain fast with 500+ items.

REQUIREMENTS:

1) CATEGORY SYSTEM (FRONTEND)
- Display menu grouped by categories:
  - Example categories: Burgers, Biryani, Pizza, Drinks, Desserts, Veg, Non-Veg, Combos, Sides, etc.
- Category list on the left (or top on mobile).
- Clicking a category scrolls or filters to that group.

2) MENU ITEM CARD FIELDS
Each item must support (using existing fields where possible):
- Name
- Photo/thumbnail
- Price
- Short description
- Tags (spicy, vegan, halal, etc.) if supported
- Availability toggle (in stock / unavailable)
- Optional:
  - Variants (Small/Medium/Large) using existing variant model if present
  - Add-ons (sauces, drinks, extras) if already modeled

3) BULK OPERATIONS (FRONTEND ONLY)
- Bulk select items to:
  - Toggle availability ON/OFF
  - Adjust price by fixed +amount or percentage (if safe)
- Implement bulk changes on frontend and send batched API calls using existing update endpoints.

4) PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
- Use virtualization/infinite scroll/pagination so UI remains smooth with 500+ items.
- Lazy-load images (don’t load 500 photos at once).
- Debounce search/filter input.

5) SEARCH & FILTERS
- Search bar: filter by item name.
- Filters:
  - Category
  - Availability (Available / Unavailable)
- Restore previous state when user comes back from another page during same session if possible.

6) EMPTY STATES & SAFETY
- If restaurant has no menu items, show an onboarding card:
  - “You don’t have any menu items yet. Start by adding your first item.”
- Do NOT remove or break existing API calls.
- Keep all validation and error handling consistent with the rest of SafeGo.

DELIVERABLE:
- Fully functional Menu Management UI able to handle 500+ items.
- Short explanation of how you handled performance (virtualization/pagination/etc.).
