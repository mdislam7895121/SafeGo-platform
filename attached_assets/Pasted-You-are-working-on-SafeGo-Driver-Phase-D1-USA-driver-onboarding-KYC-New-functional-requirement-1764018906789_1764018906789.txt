You are working on SafeGo Driver Phase D1 (USA driver onboarding & KYC).

New functional requirements from the product owner:

1) Vehicle documents section changes (on driver KYC page)
   - Location: the “Vehicle documents” / “Vehicle inspection / plate / registration” area on the `/driver/kyc-documents` page (or equivalent).
   - We no longer want image uploads for license plate.
   - Instead, we want explicit text fields for basic vehicle details.

Requirements:

A. Replace license plate image upload with structured fields
   - On the driver KYC documents page, within the vehicle-related block:
     1) Add a text input field: **Vehicle Color**
        - Example: "Black", "White", "Silver".
        - Required for USA drivers.
     2) Add a text input field: **Vehicle Model**
        - Example: "Honda Accord 2018".
        - If the driver already has a registered vehicle in the D1 vehicle system, prefill from that model information if possible; otherwise leave blank and editable.
        - Also required for USA drivers.
     3) Add a text input field: **License Plate Number**
        - Example: "NYC1230".
        - Required for USA drivers.
   - Remove the license plate **photo** upload from the UI:
     - The “License plate document” upload slot should not be shown to the driver anymore.
     - Drivers will only provide the plate number as text.

B. Remove Social Security card image upload
   - If there is currently an upload field that lets USA drivers upload a photo of their Social Security Card (or "SSN card" / "social card"):
     - Hide/remove that upload element from the KYC UI.
   - The system should rely on the SSN number field only (masked, with proper KYC validation), but no image upload of the SSN card itself.
   - Do **not** delete any existing database rows; just stop showing and using that upload type in the UI and KYC flow.
   - If a specific document type enum is used (e.g. `SOCIAL_SECURITY_CARD`), you may mark it as deprecated in code comments and exclude it from forms.

C. Persistence model updates
   - Inspect existing schema for how vehicle and KYC data are stored:
     - Check models like `Vehicle`, `DriverProfile`, `DriverKyc`, `KycDocument`, or similar.
   - Implement persistence for the new fields with minimal, non-breaking changes:
     - Preferred option:
       * Add fields to the `Vehicle` model (or whichever model already stores vehicle metadata):
         - `color` (string, nullable -> required at validation level for USA)
         - `modelDescription` or reuse existing `model` field (do not break existing data)
         - `licensePlateNumber` (string, nullable -> required at validation level for USA)
       * When the KYC vehicle details form is submitted, update the **primary vehicle** for the driver:
         - Ensure ownership is enforced (driver can only update their own vehicle).
     - If there is already a dedicated KYC/identity model that has fields for color, model, or plate number, then reuse those fields instead of adding duplicates.
   - Absolutely avoid destructive migrations:
     - Do not drop existing columns.
     - If you add new columns, use safe Prisma migrations with default values that do not break older records.

D. API and validation changes
   - Identify the API endpoints that handle driver KYC update / vehicle documents, for example:
     - `POST /api/driver/kyc-documents`
     - `PATCH /api/driver/kyc-documents`
     - or any dedicated route that saves vehicle-related KYC information.
   - Extend these endpoints so they accept:
     - `vehicleColor`
     - `vehicleModel` or `vehicleModelDescription`
     - `licensePlateNumber`
   - Add server-side validation rules:
     - For USA drivers:
       * All three fields (color, model, plate number) must be non-empty.
     - For non-USA countries, keep current behavior (do not introduce breaking requirements) unless the KYC logic already enforces them.
   - Remove dependency on a license-plate image upload in these endpoints:
     - If the current handler expects an uploaded file for the "license plate" document, make that part optional or remove it.
     - Make sure the endpoint no longer throws “Unexpected field” or similar file-upload errors when no plate image is sent.

E. Frontend UX behavior
   - On `/driver/kyc-documents`:
     - Show the three new text fields in a clear "Vehicle details" section.
     - Use helper text to explain:
       - Vehicle Color
       - Vehicle Model
       - License Plate Number (text only, no photo needed)
     - Remove any UI hints that ask the user to upload a license-plate photo or Social Security card image.
   - Preserve the other existing KYC document uploads:
     - Vehicle insurance document
     - Vehicle inspection document
     - Driver license document
     - TLC license (for NYC TLC drivers)
   - Ensure all success and error toasts are updated to reflect that these are text fields, not image uploads.

F. Security and privacy requirements
   - Continue enforcing:
     - Authenticated driver session for all KYC changes.
     - Ownership checks so drivers cannot read or modify someone else’s KYC or vehicle data.
   - Removing Social Security card image upload reduces sensitive PII exposure:
     - Make sure no new logs or debugging statements print full SSN or full plate number.
     - If logging is necessary, only log masked values.

G. Testing
   - Manually test with a USA driver account (for example, the existing `vitorgarh2` account):
     1) Visit `/driver/kyc-documents`.
     2) Fill in:
        - Vehicle Color
        - Vehicle Model
        - License Plate Number
     3) Save / submit.
     4) Confirm:
        - Data is saved in the database (Vehicle or KYC model).
        - The page reloads and shows the saved values.
        - No upload slot appears for license plate photo.
        - No Social Security card image upload is visible.
     5) Confirm other KYC document uploads (insurance, inspection, driver license, TLC) still work.
   - Also test that drivers without an existing vehicle can still complete KYC:
     - The system should either:
       * Create or update the primary vehicle with these details, or
       * Store the data in a consistent KYC record that ties back to the driver.

H. Documentation
   - Update `replit.md` with a new section, e.g. `D1-KYC-VEHICLE-FIELDS`:
     - Describe:
       * The new fields added (vehicle color, vehicle model, license plate number).
       * Where they are stored in the schema.
       * The removal of license plate photo and Social Security card image upload.
       * Any known limitations or future TODOs (e.g., plan to link these fields more tightly with the multi-vehicle system later).
