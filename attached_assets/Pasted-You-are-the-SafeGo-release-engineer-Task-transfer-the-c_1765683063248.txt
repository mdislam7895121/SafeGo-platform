You are the SafeGo release engineer. Task: transfer the current SafeGo Replit project from Personal to Team workspace, using GitHub as the source of truth, without breaking secrets, deployments, or URLs.

GOAL:
- The project must live under the TEAM workspace (not personal).
- The TEAM repo + TEAM Replit project becomes the canonical production source.
- After transfer, all routes must work and all required secrets must be present.

NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES:
1) No code copying manually between repls unless absolutely necessary. Prefer GitHub sync as the truth.
2) Do not expose secrets in code or logs.
3) After transfer, verify:
   - secrets exist in TEAM repl
   - build + run works
   - /ride /food /parcel /customer routes load
   - maps + places + eats data show as expected
4) Provide proof: screenshots or logs for GitHub connection, Secrets list (names only), and successful startup logs.

STEP-BY-STEP (DO EXACTLY):
A) Confirm current state
1. Identify current Repl owner scope: Personal vs Team
2. Identify GitHub repo URL currently connected (if any)
3. Check if Replit has “Transfer/Repl ownership” option available for this repl.
   - If direct transfer is possible → do it.
   - If not possible → create a new TEAM repl from GitHub and migrate by sync.

B) Preferred Path: Create TEAM Repl from GitHub (cleanest)
1. In TEAM workspace, create a new Repl:
   - Import from GitHub repository (SafeGo repo)
   - Ensure branch is correct (main)
2. Run install:
   - npm ci (or npm install if lock issues)
3. Set TEAM Secrets (names must match code):
   - DATABASE_URL
   - SESSION_SECRET
   - JWT_SECRET
   - ENCRYPTION_KEY
   - GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY
   - plus any payment keys already used (SSLCOMMERZ_* etc.)
4. Run production-style check:
   - npm run build
   - npm start (or the correct production start command used in this repo)
5. Verify routes:
   - /ride, /food, /parcel
   - /customer (auth redirect works)
   - login → /customer works with maps loading correctly

C) Optional Path: Direct Transfer (only if supported)
1. Transfer the repl to TEAM workspace via Replit UI.
2. Re-check GitHub integration, secrets, and deploy settings.
3. Run the same production check + route verification.

D) GitHub Ownership & Team Access (must fix if blocked)
1. Ensure GitHub repo is under an Organization (team-owned), not a personal repo:
   - If currently personal repo: transfer repository to the GitHub Organization.
2. Confirm team members have correct permissions (admin/maintain/write).
3. Connect TEAM Repl to Org repo with proper auth.

E) Post-Transfer Hardening
1. Ensure secrets are stored only in Replit Secrets and GitHub Actions secrets (if used), never in .env committed.
2. Ensure branch protection on main (optional but recommended).
3. Ensure deployment config points to TEAM repl.

DELIVERABLES (REQUIRED OUTPUT):
1) Which method used: Direct Transfer OR New TEAM repl from GitHub
2) Proof checklist:
   - GitHub connected (repo + branch)
   - Secrets present (list names only)
   - Startup success log line
   - Route verification results (pass/fail)
3) Any issues encountered + exact fixes applied.

Start now. Do not ask the user questions unless you hit a hard permission block; if blocked, describe exactly what access is missing and the minimal fix.
