Act as a senior product designer and full-stack engineer for the SafeGo Driver Web App.

Goal: Implement the SafeGo Driver Public Profile page and loyalty layout, mirroring Uber’s “Profile / View public profile” experience, using our existing SafeGo Points tier system (Blue, Gold, Premium).

Follow all existing SafeGo conventions and rules:
- Four roles: customer, driver, restaurant, admin
- Do not touch ride, food, or parcel flows
- Do not break any existing URLs, KYC, payouts, tax, or document logic
- Keep all security rules: drivers can see only their own sensitive data; riders see only allowed public info
- No emojis, no playful labels in the UI text

====================================================
1) ENTRY POINT: DRIVER PROFILE HEADER
====================================================

Current: /driver/profile shows the driver avatar and full name.

Update this page as follows:
1. Under the avatar + full name row, add a secondary button:

   Label: “View public profile”
   Route: navigates to /driver/profile/public (new page described below)

2. This button is visible only to the logged-in driver (not a public URL listing).
3. Leave the existing profile header styling, spacing, and typography intact.

====================================================
2) SAFEGO DRIVER PUBLIC PROFILE PAGE
   Route: /driver/profile/public
====================================================

Overall layout:
- Mobile-first, single-column layout similar to Uber’s public profile
- Dark or light theme should both work with the same structure
- White / neutral background cards, clear typography, no extra decorations

Sections (top to bottom):

A) Profile Hero
----------------
- Title at top: “Profile”
- Hero card with:
  - Large circular avatar
  - Driver full name (from existing profile)
  - Tier badge pill below the name, centered

Tier badge behavior:
- Read the driver’s tier from the existing SafeGo Points / loyalty logic.
  We already defined tiers:
    - Blue: 0 – 999 points
    - Gold: 1500 – 2499 points
    - Premium: 2500+ points
- Show a pill button with the label matching the tier:
    - “Blue”
    - “Gold”
    - “Premium”
- This pill should be clickable and navigate to the SafeGo Points / loyalty page
  (existing SafeGo Points route). Use the existing route; do not create a new one.
- The hero card must not show email, phone, NID, SSN, or any internal IDs.

B) About Driver (optional but recommended)
------------------------------------------
Simple text block under the hero card:
- Heading: “About”
- Fields (read-only, all optional and only if available in the profile model):
  - City and country (e.g., “New York, US”)
  - Languages (e.g., “Speaks Bangla and English”)
  - “Trips with SafeGo” summary like: “14878 trips over 4.5 years”
- This is for display only in this phase; editing stays in Account Settings.

C) Compliments Section
------------------------
Goal: Show rider compliments in a simple, Uber-style way.

Structure:
- Heading: “Compliments”
- Right side text button: “View all” (for now can scroll or link to /driver/profile/compliments if we already have it; otherwise use a placeholder route with a TODO comment)
- Below heading: a horizontal scroll row or responsive grid of compliment badges.

Data model:
- Use or create a compliment entity with:
  - id
  - title (string)
  - iconKey or type (to map to an illustration)
  - count (integer, number of times received)

Seed at least these compliment types:
- Excellent Service
- Late Night Hero
- Great Conversation
- Expert Navigation
- Neat and Tidy
- Great Amenities
- Above and Beyond

Display rules:
- Show up to 4 compliment badges on the main profile page.
- Each badge shows:
  - Illustration / icon placeholder
  - Title
  - Small count indicator (for example “4” above or near the badge)
- If there are no compliments yet, show an empty state:
  - Title: “Compliments”
  - Body: “You have not received any compliments yet. Keep driving safely and providing great service.”

D) Achievements Section
------------------------
Goal: Show lifetime stats and loyalty style highlights.

Structure:
- Heading: “Achievements”
- Use simple cards similar to Uber’s “Lifetime highlights”.

At minimum create:
1) Total Trips card
   - Title: “Total trips”
   - Value: pull from existing trip count model

2) Years with SafeGo card
   - Title: “Journey with SafeGo”
   - Value: derive years and months from driver account creation date, formatted like “4 yr 10 mo”

3) Five-Star Trips card (if we have rating breakdown)
   - Title: “Five-star trips”
   - Value: number of trips with 5-star rating, or a placeholder until data exists

If some data does not exist yet, keep the card but show a neutral placeholder “Coming soon” in the value.

====================================================
3) PRIVACY AND SECURITY RULES
====================================================

Enforce the following:
1. The public profile page must never show:
   - NID number
   - SSN or last four digits
   - Phone number
   - Email address
   - Bank or payout details
2. It may show:
   - First and last name
   - Profile photo
   - City and country
   - Rating
   - Trips and years with SafeGo
   - Tier name (Blue, Gold, Premium)
3. All driver compliments and achievements are visible only to:
   - The driver themself inside the web app
   - Future optional rider-facing views, but those must be added later; do not implement now.

====================================================
4) IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
====================================================

Routing:
- Add /driver/profile/public route, wrapped with the same driver layout and auth guard as /driver/profile.
- Ensure “View public profile” button on /driver/profile navigates correctly to this new route.

Components:
- Create a reusable PublicProfilePage component under the existing driver pages folder.
- Use shared UI primitives consistent with the rest of SafeGo (buttons, cards, typography).
- Make the page responsive and tested for mobile viewport first.

Data:
- Reuse existing driver / profile API to fetch:
  - avatar
  - name
  - rating
  - trips count
  - account creation date
  - SafeGo Points or tier value
- If compliments or achievements data does not exist yet, stub them with mock data in a clearly marked placeholder function, so we can later plug in the real API without changing the UI.

Testing:
- Verify that:
  - The “View public profile” button appears under the driver avatar on /driver/profile.
  - Clicking it opens the new /driver/profile/public page.
  - The tier pill correctly updates when the driver’s SafeGo Points tier changes (Blue, Gold, Premium).
  - Sensitive data is never shown on the public profile page.

Please implement all of the above in one complete iteration, keep the code clean and idiomatic, and then summarize what you changed, including file names and routes.
