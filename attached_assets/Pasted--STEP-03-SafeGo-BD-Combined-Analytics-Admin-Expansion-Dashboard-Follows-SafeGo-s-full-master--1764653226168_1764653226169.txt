# STEP 03 — SafeGo BD Combined Analytics & Admin Expansion Dashboard
# Follows SafeGo’s full master rules, non-breaking, BD-only expansion.

===================================================
A) BD-ONLY ANALYTICS MODULE (ADMIN PANEL)
===================================================
Create a new section under admin:
   “Bangladesh Expansion Dashboard”

Visible ONLY when admin.countryCode == "BD".

Inside this panel, add 6 analytics blocks:

1. Total BD Shop Partners
   - count of verified shops
   - pending shops
   - rejected shops

2. BD Ticket & Rental Operators
   - verified operators
   - pending operators
   - total active routes
   - total active rental vehicles

3. BD Orders Overview
   - total shop orders today
   - delivered / pending / cancelled
   - average delivery time
   - top 10 shops by sales

4. BD Ticket Bookings Overview
   - total tickets booked today
   - successful / cancelled
   - top 10 routes by demand

5. BD Rental Bookings Overview
   - total bookings today
   - completed / ongoing / cancelled
   - top 10 rental vehicles by booking count

6. BD Commission & Financials
   - total commissions earned (shop)
   - total commissions earned (ticket)
   - total commissions earned (rental)
   - outstanding negative balances:
        - drivers
        - restaurants
        - shop partners
        - ticket operators

All charts must use existing API data.
DO NOT create new backend endpoints.

===================================================
B) VISUALIZATION REQUIREMENTS
===================================================
Use simple, low-cost charts:
- Bar chart
- Line chart
- Pie chart
- Counters with icons

Bangla text labels, examples:
- "আজকের মোট অর্ডার"
- "সফল বুকিং"
- "কমিশন"
- "নেতিবাচক ব্যালেন্স"

===================================================
C) ADMIN ACTIONS (BD-ONLY)
===================================================
Within the BD Expansion Dashboard, admin can:

1. View all BD Shop Partners
   - verify
   - reject
   - view shop storefront preview

2. View Ticket & Rental Operators
   - verify
   - reject
   - view route & rental list

3. Commission Rate Panel
   - set BD shop commission percentage
   - set BD ticket commission percentage
   - set BD rental commission percentage

4. Negative Balance Settlement
   - view negative balance by user
   - mark as settled
   - export list as CSV

All must use existing /api/admin/bd-expansion/* routes.

===================================================
D) SECURITY RULES
===================================================
- US Admin must NOT see BD data.
- BD Admin must NOT see US-only structures.
- Keep total isolation between countries.
- Do not modify verification logic.

===================================================
E) PERFORMANCE & RESPONSIVENESS
===================================================
- Charts must load asynchronously.
- Use pagination for long lists.
- Mobile-friendly layout.

===================================================
F) DO NOT CHANGE BACKEND
===================================================
Only frontend layer changes.
No API structure changes.
Reuse all existing BD expansion endpoints.
