CRITICAL TASK — FULL ADMIN AUDIT & FIX (ZERO TOLERANCE)

This is a PAID task with a strict condition:
If ANY admin issue remains unfixed, the payment must be REFUNDED.
No partial fixes. No skipping. No assumptions.

SCOPE (ADMIN ONLY):
You must audit and fix the ENTIRE SafeGo Admin Panel end-to-end.
Do NOT touch landing page, customer app, maps, ride UI, or legal pages.
ADMIN ONLY.

OBJECTIVES (ALL MANDATORY):

1) ROUTING & 404 — ZERO 404 ALLOWED
- Crawl every /admin route (direct URL + refresh).
- Fix all “404 Page Not Found” issues.
- Ensure all sidebar/menu links map to valid routes.
- Add proper nested routing under /admin.
- Add Admin-only NotFound fallback (/admin/*), not global 404.

2) SIDEBAR & LAYOUT — MUST BE STABLE
- Sidebar must NOT jump, reset, or scroll to top on navigation.
- Sidebar must have its own scroll container.
- Content area must scroll independently.
- Sidebar must stay mounted across route changes.
- Layout must be height: 100vh and structurally correct.

3) PAGE INTEGRITY CHECK (EVERY ADMIN PAGE)
For EACH admin page:
- Page loads without error
- No blank screens
- No console errors
- No broken buttons or dead links
- Data placeholders handled safely (no crashes if data = empty)

4) PERMISSIONS & ACCESS
- Admin pages must be protected.
- Non-admin users must not access /admin routes.
- If role guard exists, verify it works.
- If missing, implement a basic admin guard.

5) UI CONSISTENCY
- Sidebar active state works correctly.
- Page titles render properly.
- No overlapping content.
- No broken scroll or overflow bugs.

6) FINAL VERIFICATION CHECKLIST (REQUIRED)
You MUST manually verify and confirm:
- Open /admin in new tab → works
- Refresh on deep route (/admin/observability etc.) → works
- Click every sidebar item → works
- Scroll sidebar halfway → click another item → scroll position stays
- Resize window → layout stable
- No console errors across admin

DELIVERABLES (MANDATORY):
You must provide ALL of the following:

A) Full Admin Route Table:
- Route path
- Component file
- Status (fixed / already OK)

B) Files Changed List:
- Exact filenames
- What was changed in each file

C) Root Cause Summary:
- Why 404s happened
- Why sidebar scroll was broken
- What architectural fix solved it

D) Proof of Completion:
- Clear explanation of how to reproduce and verify each fix

E) Rollback Instructions:
- Git revert or exact steps to undo changes safely

STRICT RULES:
- No guessing
- No “should work”
- No leaving TODOs
- No partial fixes
- If even ONE admin issue remains → task FAILED → REFUND REQUIRED

This is a production-critical admin panel. Treat it as such.
