Act as a senior product designer and front-end architect for the SafeGo Driver Web App.

Goal: Rebuild the Driver Profile page into an Uber-style profile and loyalty view, without touching the Driver Account Center or ride logic.

Follow all existing SafeGo master rules:
- Four roles: customer, driver, restaurant, admin (do not break cross-role logic).
- Keep all existing KYC, payouts, tax, and wallet systems untouched.
- Do not change any ride, food, or parcel matching logic.
- Do not break any existing URLs or API contracts.
- Respect the SafeGo Points tier system (Blue, Gold, Premium) that is already implemented.
- No emojis in any UI text.

========================
1) NAVIGATION BEHAVIOR
========================

1. When the driver taps the profile header in the left sidebar (avatar + name + rating + location) on any driver route, open the main driver profile page.

2. Use this route for the main profile page:
   - Path: /driver/profile
   - This page is the DRIVER PROFILE + LOYALTY view.
   - Do NOT move or change any existing /driver/account/... routes (those are for account settings).

3. Keep the existing sidebar and top app bar as they are. Only change the content area of /driver/profile.

========================
2) PROFILE HEADER LAYOUT
========================

Rebuild the top of /driver/profile to match Uber’s profile layout, but in SafeGo’s light theme:

- Page title: "Profile" at the top left of the content area.
- Main profile card centered at the top with:
  - Large circular avatar (reuse the driver profile photo).
  - Full driver name in large bold text next to the avatar.
  - Directly attached to the avatar frame, show a SafeGo tier pill:
    - Text: current tier name from existing tier logic (for example: "Blue", "Gold", "Premium").
    - Background: subtle pill style, no emoji, no loud colors.
  - Under the name, show:
    - Primary email
    - Primary city and country (for example: "New York, US").
  - Secondary button on the right: "View public profile"
    - For now, this can just navigate to a placeholder route or do nothing, but keep the UI element.

Design requirements:
- Keep spacing, typography, and card edges consistent with the current SafeGo driver UI.
- White background, light grey dividers, and soft shadows like the existing cards in the app.

================================
3) SAFEGO POINTS AND TIER CARD
================================

Under the profile header, add a "SafeGo Points" card that uses the existing points and tier logic:

- Card title: "SafeGo Points and tier"
- Show:
  - Current tier (Blue, Gold, or Premium) pulled from the existing tier logic.
  - Current points value (for example: "1,420 points").
  - A progress bar showing progress to the next tier.
    - Label under the bar: 
      - If not at top tier: "Next tier at [X] points"
      - If at top tier: "You are at the highest tier"
- Add a small inline tier summary using the current implementation, for example:
  - Blue: entry tier
  - Gold: mid tier with additional benefits
  - Premium: highest tier with full benefits

Important:
- Do NOT reimplement the tier math here. Read the current tier and points from the same place the SafeGo Points page uses.
- Do NOT add any new business rules; just display what already exists.

=================================
4) PERFORMANCE STATS (RIDES AREA)
=================================

Below the SafeGo Points card, add a "Driving performance" section using 4 stat tiles, similar to Uber:

Section title: "Driving performance"

Four tiles in a responsive grid (2x2 on mobile, 4 in a row on desktop):

1) Acceptance rate
   - Large number (for example "84%").
   - Subtitle: "Acceptance rate"
   - Pull this value from existing stats if available, otherwise use placeholder data and mark as "Sample data" in code comments only.

2) Cancellation rate
   - Large number (for example "7%").
   - Subtitle: "Cancellation rate"

3) Star rating
   - Large number (for example "4.96").
   - Subtitle: "Star rating"
   - This must use the same rating value already shown in the sidebar (to avoid inconsistency).

4) Driving score
   - Large number (for example "94").
   - Subtitle: "Driving insights score" or similar internal metric.
   - If there is no real metric yet, use a placeholder but keep the UI ready.

Design details:
- Each tile is a card with:
  - Left-aligned text.
  - No emojis, clean typography.
  - Consistent heights and padding.

=================================
5) LIFETIME HIGHLIGHTS SECTION
=================================

Add a "Lifetime highlights" section under the performance tiles, similar to Uber:

Section title: "Lifetime highlights"

Two large cards in a row on desktop (stacked on mobile):

1) Total trips card:
   - Large icon area (vector illustration placeholder like a generic map pin).
   - Text:
     - Big number, for example "14,878"
     - Label: "Total trips"
   - Pull the real trip count if available; otherwise use a placeholder and clearly mark as sample data in comments.

2) Journey with SafeGo card:
   - Big text like "4 yr 10 mo"
   - Label: "Journey with SafeGo"
   - Calculate based on the driver account created date if available; otherwise use placeholder and comments.

=================================
6) BADGES AND ACHIEVEMENTS
=================================

Add a "Badges" section at the bottom of the profile page:

Section title: "Badges"

- Show a horizontal list of badge chips or circle badges (for example: 
  - "100 five-star trips"
  - "1 year with SafeGo"
  - "Weekend hero"
- For now, use static seed badges, but structure the UI and data model so we can attach real badge data later:
  - Each badge has:
    - Icon placeholder
    - Title
    - Optional short description tooltip

Important:
- Do not change or break any existing badge logic if something is already implemented elsewhere.
- If there is no badge system yet, keep all badge content in a separate component so it can be wired later.

=================================
7) INTERACTION AND ROUTING RULES
=================================

1. Tapping the profile header in the left sidebar always opens /driver/profile with this new layout.
2. All actions on this page must be read-only for now:
   - Do not allow editing of name, photo, or KYC from this page.
   - Editing continues to live in the Driver Account Center (/driver/account/...), which you must not change in this task.
3. The "View public profile" button can:
   - Either navigate to a placeholder route like /driver/profile/public
   - Or open a modal with "Coming soon" text.
   - Choose the simplest option without breaking anything.

=================================
8) RESPONSIVE AND TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
=================================

- Use the same design system and component library already used in the driver web app (shadcn/ui or equivalent).
- Keep the page mobile-first and responsive:
  - Single column on small screens.
  - Multi-column layout for tiles and cards on larger screens.
- Do not introduce any new global CSS resets.
- Reuse existing typography, colors, and spacing tokens so the page feels native to SafeGo.
- Add data-testid attributes where appropriate to support future automated tests.

=================================
9) SAFETY AND PRIVACY
=================================

- Do not expose any sensitive identifiers (NID, SSN, full tax IDs, bank details) on this profile page.
- This profile page is for performance and loyalty only.
- All sensitive KYC and tax views remain in the Account Center and Tax Info sections, which you must not modify in this task.

After implementing, review the entire /driver/profile page and:
- Confirm sidebar header click opens this page correctly.
- Confirm no online/offline or job controls appear here.
- Confirm all existing routes and account pages continue to work without change.
