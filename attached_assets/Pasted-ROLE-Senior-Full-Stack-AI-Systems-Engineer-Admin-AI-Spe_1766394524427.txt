ROLE: Senior Full-Stack AI Systems Engineer (Admin AI Specialist)

PROJECT:
Fix and professionalize **Admin SafePilot** so it behaves as a true enterprise-grade admin AI assistant.

NON-NEGOTIABLE GOALS:
1. Admin SafePilot must NOT reuse Customer Support logic, prompts, models, or formatters.
2. Same question must NOT return the same static response.
3. Responses must be intent-based, data-aware, and context-specific.
4. UI output must be clean, professional, and enterprise-style (no repeated headers, no canned text).
5. Customer Support AI behavior must remain unchanged.

---

SCOPE (DO NOT SKIP ANY):

A. STRICT ROLE ISOLATION
- Create or enforce a hard separation:
  - Admin SafePilot
  - Customer Support AI
- No shared prompt files
- No shared formatter functions
- No shared response templates

---

B. INTENT-BASED RESPONSE ENGINE (MANDATORY)
- Implement intent classification for admin queries:
  - Metrics / KPIs
  - KYC queues
  - Fraud & risk
  - Payments & payouts
  - Drivers & operations
  - System health
- Route each intent to a dedicated handler.
- Never return a generic summary if a specific intent is detected.

---

C. REMOVE STATIC RESPONSE BEHAVIOR
- Identify and FIX any function that:
  - Adds fixed headers (e.g. [GUARD MODE], [MODE])
  - Injects the same “Summary / Signals / Actions” block for all queries
- Responses must be assembled dynamically based on:
  - Question intent
  - Data availability
  - Time range
  - Admin permissions

---

D. RESPONSE FORMAT RULES (ADMIN STANDARD)
- No emojis
- No marketing language
- No repeated boilerplate
- Use this structure ONLY when relevant:

  Title (1 line)
  Key Findings (bullets)
  Data Snapshot (optional, table or bullets)
  Risks / Notes (only if applicable)
  Recommended Actions (actionable, admin-level)

- If data is unavailable, explain WHY and suggest the next best query.

---

E. MODEL & LOGIC
- Admin SafePilot must use:
  - Advanced model profile
  - Intent detection = ON
  - Cross-domain reasoning = ON
- Customer Support model settings must remain untouched.

---

F. SETTINGS INTEGRATION
Admin SafePilot must respect these settings:
- Response length
- Tone
- Data scope
- Guard mode
- Logging
- Auto-send behavior
- Quick actions enable/disable

---

G. QUICK ACTIONS (ADMIN ONLY)
- Quick actions must:
  - Populate the input with a real query
  - Respect intent routing
  - Produce different answers depending on current data
- Never send a placeholder or demo response.

---

H. VALIDATION & FALLBACK
- If schema validation fails:
  - Extract the raw question
  - Classify intent manually
  - Continue execution
- NEVER respond with:
  “Please provide a valid question”

---

I. TEST CASES (YOU MUST RUN THESE)
1. Ask about KYC age buckets → must return real breakdown logic
2. Ask about fraud signals → must NOT return KYC content
3. Ask same question twice → responses must differ in wording or data framing
4. Switch page → SafePilot context must update
5. Customer Support page → Admin SafePilot must NOT appear

---

J. DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS
- Make all changes incremental (non-breaking)
- Clearly comment admin-only logic
- Do NOT refactor unrelated files
- Ensure production-ready cleanliness

---

FINAL CHECK:
If Admin SafePilot still gives the same answer to different questions, the task is NOT complete.

Proceed step-by-step, test after each change, and only finish when Admin SafePilot behaves like a real enterprise admin AI.
