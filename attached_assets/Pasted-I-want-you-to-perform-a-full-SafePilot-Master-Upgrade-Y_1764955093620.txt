I want you to perform a full SafePilot Master Upgrade.  
Your goal is to transform SafePilot into a world-class, enterprise-grade AI operations engine that reduces company cost, increases automation, and strengthens platform safety.

Follow these instructions carefully and complete ALL tasks in order:

1. Fix all remaining issues with SafePilot Context Mode.
   – Ensure page-context loads on every admin page, including mobile and tablet view.
   – If the page context is unavailable, SafePilot must still respond using fallback data sources.
   – Add debugging logs so we can see why context fails.

2. Upgrade SafePilot Intelligence Engine (Vision 2030+) to Master Level:
   – Real-time risk scoring for fraud, abuse, KYC issues, driver safety, trip anomalies.
   – Automatic recommendations with actions:
       SAFE, CAUTION, HIGH RISK (needs approval).
   – Add cross-module reasoning: SafePilot should combine multiple signals into one conclusion.
   – Add cost-reduction analysis: optimize fuel cost, trip matching, refunds, incentives.

3. Add Full Mobile Responsiveness:
   – Every SafePilot panel and intelligence module must load properly on mobile.
   – Context tab, Intel tab, Chat tab, History tab must be fully interactive.
   – No blank screen, no overflow, no layout break.
   – Test on narrow screens and apply adaptive layouts.

4. Add Voice Command Mode (future-ready):
   – SafePilot should accept short voice queries (placeholder mode if needed).
   – Add UI button and stub backend so we can enable voice in future.

5. Add Background Autonomous Monitoring:
   – SafePilot should continuously scan:
       • Fraud and high-risk users  
       • Driver behavior anomalies  
       • Abnormal spikes in new accounts  
       • Sudden refund increases  
       • Suspicious payment integrity issues  
   – When it detects something important, it should notify admin with CLEAR explanation and recommended action.

6. Add “Explain This Decision” mode:
   – When SafePilot blocks a user, flags fraud, or makes a recommendation,
     it must explain WHY with the data it used.

7. Add Company Survival Mode (for low-budget startup use):
   – Minimize operational load by automating repetitive tasks.
   – Identify where human admin is not required.
   – Suggest cost-cutting options weekly.
   – Suggest growth opportunities and income-boosting ideas.

8. Add API and Backend Stability Improvements:
   – Fix SafePilot errors like:
       “Failed to process your question”
       “Unable to load context”
   – Add retries, better validation, and structured error messages.
   – Ensure backend routes always return Vision 2030 formatted responses.

9. Add “One-Click Crisis Report” mode:
   – When admin asks:
         “What is happening right now?”
     SafePilot must generate:
       • top 5 risks  
       • top 5 opportunities  
       • urgent fixes  
       • recommended next steps  
       • financial impact  
       • operational impact  

10. After finishing all tasks:
    – Show me a summary of everything you upgraded.
    – Show test instructions so I can verify the system.
    – Ask if I want to publish.
