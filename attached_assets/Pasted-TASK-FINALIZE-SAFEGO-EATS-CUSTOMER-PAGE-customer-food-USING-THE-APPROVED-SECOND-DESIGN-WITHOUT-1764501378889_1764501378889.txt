TASK: FINALIZE SAFEGO EATS CUSTOMER PAGE (/customer/food)
USING THE APPROVED SECOND DESIGN — WITHOUT BREAKING DESKTOP VIEW.

CRITICAL RULE:
YOU MUST FIX ONLY MOBILE/TABLET LAYOUTS.
YOU MUST NOT BREAK OR MODIFY THE EXISTING DESKTOP DESIGN STRUCTURE.
DESKTOP VIEW (≥ 1024px) MUST REMAIN EXACTLY AS IT IS.

APPROVED DESIGN:
User selected the SECOND DESIGN:
- Vertical large restaurant cards
- Big image on left
- Name + Rating + Open badge
- Clean spacing, no clutter

WHAT YOU MUST DO:
1) KEEP desktop UI EXACTLY as it is. No resizing, no margin changes, no card redesign.
2) APPLY the selected SECOND DESIGN ONLY for mobile + tablet breakpoints.
3) FIX all broken/missing restaurant images (Bella’s, Sultan’s Biryani, etc.)
4) ENSURE mobile scrolling works correctly (no clipping, no overlap).
5) REMOVE legacy small-card layout from mobile. DO NOT DELETE CODE. Just disable its usage.

BREAKPOINT RULES:
- Mobile: ≤ 640px → use Second Design vertical full-width card
- Tablet: 641–1023px → scale the second design proportionally
- Desktop: ≥ 1024px → DO NOT TOUCH existing layout (leave as-is)

MOBILE FIXES REQUIRED:
- Proper vertical scroll
- No cut-off cards
- Image aspect-ratio 1.6:1 with object-fit: cover
- Safe text wrapping + ellipsis
- 44px tap target for heart/favorite icon
- Clean spacing between cards (16px)

IMAGE FIX RULES:
- Read all demo restaurants
- Repair invalid image URLs
- Apply correct HTTPS Unsplash URLs
- Add fallback image:
    onError → safego_default_restaurant.png

FILTER & SEARCH BEHAVIOR:
- Cuisine filters (Chinese, Bengali, Japanese, etc.) → MUST show only mobile cards
- Top Rated/Open/Favorites → MUST use same second-design layout
- Search bar must remain functional across all breakpoints

FILES YOU WILL WORK IN:
- client/src/pages/customer/food/*
- client/src/components/eats/*
Do not modify shared components used by rides, deliveries, admin, or restaurant dashboards.

NON-DESTRUCTIVE REQUIREMENT:
- Do NOT break schema, API, or desktop UI.
- Only override mobile/tablet CSS + layout render conditions.

MANDATORY SELF-TEST BEFORE COMPLETION:
1) Mobile view (390px) shows only second design.
2) Tablet view (768px) shows proportional second design.
3) Desktop view (1024px+) remains EXACTLY as before — no visual changes.
4) All restaurant images load (or fallback).
5) Scroll is smooth top-to-bottom.
6) Filters update restaurant list using the second design only.
