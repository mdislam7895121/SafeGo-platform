Task: Redesign the SafeGo customer booking page for mobile view (small screens) so that it behaves like Uber’s mobile experience, while keeping the current desktop layout and all pricing/dispatch logic exactly as they are.

Important rules
- Do NOT change fares, surge, promos, commission, payouts, matching, or routing logic.
- Desktop layout (2-column with map on the right, ride list on the left) must stay the same for large screens.
- This task is ONLY about the responsive layout and visual structure for mobile (small widths).

Target routes
- Unified booking page: /customer (or /customer/unified-booking, whichever is currently used for the new design).
- Apply the same responsive rules anywhere this layout appears.

1. Add a proper mobile breakpoint
- Introduce a breakpoint at around max-width: 768px (you can adjust slightly if needed).
- For widths above the breakpoint: keep the current desktop layout exactly as it is.
- For widths at or below the breakpoint: switch to a dedicated mobile layout described below.

2. Mobile layout structure (single column, Uber-style)
On small screens, restructure the page into a single vertical column:

Order (top → bottom):
  1) Header bar
     - SafeGo logo + current tab (Ride / Eats / Parcel) as we already show.
     - Keep height compact.

  2) Address capsule block
     - Combine pickup and dropoff into one vertical card over the map.
     - Use rounded “capsule” style instead of a large rectangular panel:
       • Full width minus small side padding.
       • Rounded corners (e.g., 9999px).
       • Light background (#F9FAFB).
       • Thin border (#E5E7EB).
     - Inside the capsule show:
       • First row: pickup dot + pickup address (single line, ellipsis if long).
       • Second row: dropoff dot + dropoff address.
     - On the right side of the capsule:
       • A small up/down chevron button to expand/collapse full address editor.
       • A small pencil icon button to edit both addresses.
     - When expanded, show the full pickup/dropoff input fields below, in the same card.

  3) Promo banner
     - If a promo is active, show a pill banner just under the address capsule:
       • Background: light green (#ECFDF3).
       • Text: "SafeGo Everyday Saver · 15% off your ride" (or current promo name).
       • Smaller secondary text: "Applied automatically".
     - If no promo is active: hide this banner completely.

  4) Route selector (horizontal chips)
     - Show the available routes as full-width chips but inside a horizontal scroll area.
       Example:
         [ Fastest · 1h 43m · 94.9 mi ] [ CT-15 N and CT-8 N ] [ I-684 N … ]
     - Each chip:
       • Rounded pill.
       • Selected route = blue border + light blue background.
       • Non-selected routes = neutral border.
     - Make sure that even on small screens:
       • All chips are visible via horizontal scrolling.
       • The *rightmost* chip is not cut off.

  5) Ride list (full-width cards, vertical list)
     - Show each ride option as a full-width card stacked vertically (no 2×2 grid on mobile).
     - Card content:
       • Left: car image.
       • Middle: title + caption:
           "SafeGo X"
           "2 min away · 4 seats"
       • Right: price section with promo:
           - Original price (gray, small, strikethrough).
           - Final price (bold, larger).
           - Small “Saver” badge in green if discount applied.
     - Add small badges like "Popular" / "Limited" in the top-right of each card, same as desktop.
     - Tapping on a card:
       • Selects that ride.
       • Updates the selected ride summary and confirm button text below.

  6) Selected ride summary + traffic + payment (compact)
     - Under the ride list, show only the currently selected ride summary in a compact block:
       • Car image + ride name + price + "You save $X.XX" if applicable.
       • Traffic badge from the previous task ("Light traffic / Moderate / Heavy") in the correct color.
       • Payment method chip (e.g., "Card/Wallet").
     - Make sure this block is not too tall on mobile.

  7) Sticky bottom confirm button (like Uber)
     - At the very bottom, add a sticky, full-width primary button that stays visible:
       • Label format: "Confirm SafeGo X · $235.01"
         (use the selected ride name and current total fare).
       • Button height ~52–56px, large rounded corners at top.
       • Sticks above the system safe-area on mobile.
     - When the button is tapped:
       • Keep the existing booking/confirm logic exactly as before.
       • No change to backend behavior.

3. Mobile map behavior
- On desktop: keep current side-by-side map as-is (right column).
- On mobile:
  • Do NOT render the map as a full-height right column.
  • Instead, show a compact "View on map" / "Choose on map" button below the route chips or just above the ride list.
  • Tapping this opens one of:
      - A full-screen overlay with the map and the current routes, OR
      - A bottom sheet where the upper 60–70% is the map and the lower area shows the route chips.
  • When the user switches route from the map view, update the selected route and ETA on the main page.

4. Typography & spacing adjustments for mobile
- Reduce font sizes slightly for headings and labels so they fit nicely on narrow screens.
- Keep:
  • Clear section titles: "Choose your route", "Choose a ride".
  • Enough vertical spacing between sections (12–16px).
- Avoid horizontal scrolling for any content except the route chips.

5. Consistency and safety
- All data shown (prices, discounts, promos, fees, traffic, ETA) must be exactly the same as desktop; only the layout changes.
- Test flows to confirm:
  • Desktop layout is unchanged.
  • On mobile width (e.g., iPhone 15 Pro simulator in the Replit preview), the page shows:
     - Address capsule at top,
     - Promo banner,
     - Route chips (scrollable),
     - Vertical ride list,
     - Compact summary,
     - Sticky bottom "Confirm SafeGo [Ride]" button,
     - Optional “View on map” flow.
