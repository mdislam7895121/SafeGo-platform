Title: Fix /customer/ride bottom sheet layout and always show "Request ride" button

Follow ALL existing SafeGo rules. Do NOT touch any backend logic:
- no changes to fare calculation, promos, commission, driver earnings,
  dispatch, or route selection.
Only adjust the UI layout and styling of the customer ride screen.

Context:
On the `/customer/ride` page the new design looks messy on mobile:
- The bottom section (cards + promo) is too tall.
- A solid blue bar is visible, but the "Request ride" label is missing or
  clipped.
- The overall layout feels crowded and unbalanced.

Goal:
Make the ride screen clean and Uber-like:
- Map + route visible at the top.
- A structured bottom sheet that contains promo, heading, ride cards and
  the Request ride button, with proper spacing.
- The "Request ride" button must always be visible and readable.

Tasks:

1. Bottom sheet structure
   Refactor the bottom content into a clear vertical structure:

   [A] SafeGo Everyday Saver banner (if promo active)
   [B] Section title line
       - Icon: car
       - Text: "Choose your ride"
       - This line is inside the bottom sheet, not floating over the map.
   [C] Ride cards (SafeGo X, SafeGo Comfort, etc.)
   [D] Request ride button

   All of A–D should live in one container that behaves like a bottom sheet
   anchored to the bottom of the screen.

2. Height and scroll behavior
   For mobile viewport:
   - The bottom sheet should have:
       max-height: around 55–60vh (not full screen).
       min-height: enough to show 1–2 cards plus the Request ride button.
   - If the number of ride cards exceeds the available height, make the
     cards area scrollable:
       - ONLY the cards container scrolls (A + B + D stay fixed).
   - The map area above must always remain visible, at least ~35–40% of the
     viewport height.

3. Request ride button fixes
   - Ensure the "Request ride" button is:
       height: 52–56px
       full width of the bottom sheet (with left/right padding)
       corner radius consistent with rest of the app
   - Label text: "Request ride" (same as before).
   - Text must be centered, visible, and not clipped on iOS Safari.
   - The button must always be visible:
       - Use a sticky/footer style inside the bottom sheet
         (e.g., position: sticky; bottom: 0) OR keep it at the very bottom
         of the sheet with padding so it never scrolls off.

4. Spacing and alignment cleanup
   - Add consistent padding around the bottom sheet:
       padding: 16px inside the sheet.
   - Between elements:
       - 8–10px between banner and "Choose your ride" heading.
       - 8px between heading and cards container.
       - 12–16px between cards container and Request ride button.
   - Make sure card heights are uniform so the sheet looks tidy.

5. Desktop behavior
   - On desktop, keep the current multi-column grid layout for the cards.
   - Apply the same vertical structure: banner → heading → cards → Request
     ride button.
   - On larger screens, the bottom content does not need to behave like a
     sliding sheet, but the Request ride button should still be clearly
     visible without overlapping the map or being cropped.

6. Do NOT change:
   - Any fare, promo, or "You save" calculations.
   - Any of the SafeGo ride card redesign from C7 (image, price, titles).
   - Any API calls or ride request behavior.

Acceptance criteria:
   - On mobile, when a user selects pickup/dropoff, the map is visible at
     the top and the bottom sheet is visually separated and tidy.
   - The SafeGo Everyday Saver banner, "Choose your ride" heading, ride
     cards, and Request ride button appear in that order.
   - The "Request ride" button is always visible, with centered label, and
     is not covered or cropped by any other element.
   - Desktop layout keeps the same information hierarchy and looks clean.
