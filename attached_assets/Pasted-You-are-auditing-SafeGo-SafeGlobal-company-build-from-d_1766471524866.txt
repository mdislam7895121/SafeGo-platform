You are auditing SafeGo/SafeGlobal company build from day 1 to now. Produce a single, complete “Company Build Report” where NOTHING is omitted. The report must be evidence-based, derived from the repo + Replit project structure + env configs + deployed URLs + admin panel + customer app. Do not guess. If something is unknown, mark it as “Unknown (needs confirmation)” and list exactly what file/log is missing.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENT:
- One report with numbered sections and a master index.
- Include “Inventory Tables” for every module and every route/page/service.
- Include “Evidence” for each item: file path(s), route name(s), API endpoint(s), DB models, and screenshots/log references if available.
- Include a “What works now vs broken now” matrix.
- Include “Next steps” and “Owner/Role” for each gap.

SCOPE (must cover ALL):
1) Company Overview
- Legal/brand names used (SafeGo, SafeGlobal, SafePilot)
- Regions: USA + Bangladesh rules differences
- Services: Ride, Food, Parcel, Shop (BD), Tickets (BD)
- Current live URLs (safegoglobal.com, Replit deployments)

2) Architecture Inventory (end-to-end)
- Frontend(s): Customer app (Expo/React Native), Web admin, Support console (if any)
- Backend: Node/Express routes count, folder structure, middleware, auth, payments, notifications
- Database: SQL/ORM models, enums, migrations
- External integrations: Maps/Places, Payment gateways (Stripe/SSLCommerz etc), SMS/Email, Push notifications

3) Repo Inventory (MANDATORY)
- Print full tree summary:
  - /server (services, routes, controllers, middleware)
  - /app or /mobile (Expo routes, screens)
  - /admin (dashboard, pages)
  - /components (shared)
  - /src/lib (helpers)
- List all key config files: package.json, tsconfig, env, build configs
- List all scripts and CI (if exists)

4) Features Built (Module by Module) with evidence
A) Customer App
- Onboarding/auth flows (customer-only signup rule respected)
- Landing/Home (/ride is landing experience)
- Ride flow: location search, map, choose ride, pricing/ETA from backend, payment UI, order/booking status
- Food flow: browse, cart, checkout, order tracking
- Parcel flow: create delivery, pricing, tracking
- Shop (BD): catalog, checkout, order
- Tickets (BD): ticket browse, booking
- Notifications and receipts
For each: list routes/screens + API dependencies + current status (Working/Partial/Broken/Stub)

B) Admin Panel (Enterprise)
- Dashboard, People & KYC, Users, Drivers, Restaurants, Parcels
- Management: KYC approvals, Wallets, Payouts
- Analytics & reports
- RBAC/roles, audit logs
For each: pages + APIs + DB models + status

C) Support Console (if separate)
- Ticketing, macros, customer lookup, refunds/disputes, SLA
- SafePilot support-only scope
Evidence + status

D) Backend APIs
- Auth, user/driver/restaurant management
- KYC workflow (BD + US rules)
- Pricing engine (shared backend, not duplicated in frontend)
- Dispatch/status engine (rides/food/parcel)
- Payments + payouts + wallet
- Fraud/security signals
For each: route files list + endpoints + request/response contracts + status

E) SafePilot AI System
- Admin SafePilot: intents, scopes, handlers, settings UI, logging, read-only mode
- Support SafePilot: support-only intents and data access
- Separation proof: endpoints or source flags, different prompts/models, scope enforcement
- Known issues: “same answer” bug, formatting functions, routing
Evidence: file paths, functions, settings schema

5) Security & Compliance Inventory (must be explicit)
- Auth security (JWT/session), password policy
- RBAC, admin protection, rate limits
- Data protection, PII handling/redaction
- Audit logging
- Country-specific KYC compliance (BD vs US)
- Threat model: top risks + current mitigations + gaps

6) Operations & Reliability
- Error handling, monitoring/logging
- Background jobs/queues
- Performance hotspots
- Backup/restore strategy

7) Test & Release Readiness
- Unit tests, integration tests, e2e (what exists, what missing)
- Build pipeline (Expo/EAS, Replit deploy)
- App Store/TestFlight status (if applicable)
- Release checklist

8) Single Source of Truth Tables (NO OMISSIONS)
- Table 1: All frontend routes/screens with status
- Table 2: All admin pages with status
- Table 3: All backend endpoints with status
- Table 4: All DB models/enums with owners and usage
- Table 5: All third-party integrations with keys/env dependencies
- Table 6: All AI intents/domains/handlers + settings toggles + expected outputs
- Table 7: Known bugs/issues list with severity + fix plan

9) Final Summary
- What is production-ready today
- What blocks launch
- Next 30/60/90 day plan (prioritized)
- Ownership roles (admin ops, support ops, engineering)

PROCESS (how to build the report):
- First: scan repo tree and list everything.
- Second: map routes/pages/endpoints/models.
- Third: open key files to verify behavior (no guesses).
- Fourth: run minimal smoke checks (if possible) or state exactly which checks cannot be run.
- Fifth: write the report with evidence references.

Start now. Produce the report in English with clear headings and numbered sections. No marketing fluff.
