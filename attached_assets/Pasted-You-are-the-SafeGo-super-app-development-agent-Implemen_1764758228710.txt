3. Restaurant Owner
4. Shop Partner (BD-only)
5. Ticket & Rental Operator (BD-only)

USA users should ONLY see:

BD users should see ALL FIVE.

🔥 BACKEND LOGIC
====================================================

When a card is clicked:

1. Check user authentication.
2. Determine user country.
3. Load or create a partner_profile for that role with fields:
   - user_id
   - role: (ride_driver | delivery_driver | restaurant | shop_partner | ticket_operator)
   - country (BD/US)
   - partner_status (draft)
   - trust_level (customer_basic)

4. Redirect the user to the correct onboarding flow.

====================================================
🔥 ONBOARDING ROUTE CREATION
====================================================

Create the following routes:

/partner/ride/start  
/partner/delivery/start  
/partner/restaurant/start  
/partner/shop/start (BD only)
/partner/ticket/start (BD only)

Each start page loads:

- If partner_profile exists → show dashboard with checklist  
- If not → start Step 1 (business basic info)

====================================================
🔥 COUNTRY RULES
====================================================

BD users see:
- ride driver
- delivery driver
- restaurant
- shop partner
- ticket operator

USA users see:
- ride driver
- delivery driver
- restaurant

BD KYC requirements stay in place:
- father_name
- present_address
- nid_number
- images etc.

USA drivers require:
- DOB
- home_address
- driver_license_number, driver_license_image

====================================================
🔥 FRONTEND LOCATION (IMPORTANT)
====================================================

Modify this page:

/customer/profile

Add a new section:

"🚀 Become a Partner"

Then show the dynamic card grid.

====================================================
🔥 SECURITY (S1–S5)
====================================================

S1 – Auth & Role  
- Only logged-in users can start onboarding
- Prevent role spoofing

S2 – Validation  
- Validate business_name, phone, etc.

S3 – Isolation  
- Partner can access only their own profile

S4 – Audit Logs  
- Log PARTNER_ONBOARDING_STARTED

S5 – Abuse Protection  
- Rate-limit onboarding attempts

====================================================
🔥 FINISHING CONDITIONS
====================================================

1. After implementation, login as BD customer:
   - Visit /customer/profile
   - Confirm all 5 cards appear
   - Click one → onboarding starts

2. Login as USA customer:
   - Visit profile → only 3 cards appear

3. All routes must open without errors.

4. All cards must show premium glow styling.
