## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend uses React 18, TypeScript, Vite 5, shadcn/ui (Radix UI), Tailwind CSS 3, TanStack Query v5, wouter, and React Hook Form with Zod. It features a custom HSL color palette, Inter/Manrope typography, mobile-first responsive design, skeleton loading states, toast notifications, error boundaries, protected routes with role-based access control, and a unified payout/payment section. The Customer Web App includes multi-step onboarding, country-specific KYC, service booking, and a dedicated Food System. Profile experiences for customers and drivers are designed to Uber-level quality with modern UI and enhanced features. The Driver Web App incorporates a unified navigation layout with clickable sidebar profile header.

**Driver Profile System**: Three-page profile experience mirroring Uber's layout:
1. **Main Profile** (/driver/profile): Uber-style profile with large avatar, tier pill, name, email, location, SafeGo Points card with tier progress, driving performance stats (acceptance rate, cancellation rate, star rating, driving score), lifetime highlights (total trips, journey time), and achievement badges. Includes "View public profile" button. Read-only view; all editing in Account Center.
2. **Public Profile** (/driver/profile/public): Driver-facing view showing avatar, name, clickable tier badge pill (links to /driver/points), About section (city, country, languages, trips summary), Compliments section with 7 seed types (Excellent Service, Late Night Hero, Great Conversation, Expert Navigation, Neat and Tidy, Great Amenities, Above and Beyond), and Achievements section (total trips, years with SafeGo, five-star trips). Privacy-compliant: no NID, SSN, phone, email, or bank details shown.
3. **Compliments Detail** (/driver/profile/compliments): Placeholder for detailed compliments view.

Sidebar profile header is clickable and navigates to /driver/profile using wouter Link component.

### Technical Implementations
The backend is built with Node.js 20+, TypeScript, Express.js 4, and Prisma Client 6 with PostgreSQL 14+. It supports multi-role authentication, country-specific KYC, and comprehensive service lifecycle management. Core features include:
- **Admin Capabilities**: An interactive admin panel with a dashboard, Document Center, Wallet Settlement System, Global Earnings & Payout Analytics, and advanced analytics.
- **Security & Compliance**: Admin Activity Audit Trail, Global Admin Notification Center, Global Admin Settings Panel, advanced Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), secure UX components, real-time threat monitoring, and a fraud detection engine.
- **Wallet & Earnings System**: Financial management for tracking earnings, commissions, negative balances, and automated/manual payout processing.
- **Tax & Fees System**: Uber-style multi-country tax management with city-level overrides, supporting 7 tax types (VAT, Sales Tax, Government Service Fee, Marketplace Facilitator Tax, Trip Fee, Local Municipality Fee, Regulatory Fee). Tax calculations use a simple stacking method, and a detailed tax breakdown is stored in all transaction records.
- **System Monitoring**: Real-time performance monitoring, stability alerts, and an enterprise performance dashboard.
- **Support Chat System**: Real-time WebSocket-integrated support chat with full CRUD and RBAC checks.
- **Demo Mode**: Comprehensive demo data generation for multi-jurisdiction scenarios.
- **Opportunity Bonus Management System**: Allows admins to create and manage ride incentives with country-specific amounts, promotional campaigns, and zone-based targeting. Drivers view dynamic opportunity bonuses on their Promotions page.
- **SafeGo Points System**: Uber Pro-style gamified loyalty program with **3 exclusive tiers** and **90-day cycles**: Blue (1000-1499 points), Gold (1500-2499 points), and Premium (2500+ points). Drivers with less than 1000 points have "no tier yet" status. Points are earned through completed trips with **time-based rewards**: Night/Morning shifts (12 AM-8 AM, 8 AM-3 PM) = 1 point, Peak Evening (3 PM-5 PM) = 3 points, Evening shift (5 PM-12 AM) = 5 points. **90-Day Cycle System**: Status points (used for tier calculation) reset every 90 days, while lifetime points are preserved for analytics. Drivers must maintain minimum points to keep their tier. Strict enforcement: 1499 points ≠ Gold tier, 2499 points ≠ Premium tier. Features include: (1) Driver UI at /driver/points showing current tier, 90-day cycle status (days remaining, cycle progress), progress bar, tier roadmap with 3 tiers, tier benefits, and activity ledger; (2) **TimeSlotPointEngine** for server-validated, tamper-proof point calculation with fraud detection; (3) **CycleTrackingService** for 90-day rolling window management and automatic resets; (4) Admin API endpoints for tier management (displayOrder is read-only), rules management, and driver overview; (5) Security controls with drivers seeing only their own points, admin changes requiring audit logging, and RBAC checks; (6) Backend PointsService with tier calculation logic always sorting by displayOrder ASC.
- **Driver Wallet System**: Uber-style wallet experience with SafeGo branding featuring two main pages: (1) Wallet Home displaying current balance, recent payouts, payout method, and cash-out button; (2) Balance Details showing transaction timeline with date grouping, type filters, and summary breakdown. Includes 7 backend APIs for wallet management: summary, payouts, balance timeline, transaction details, payout method, and cash-out. All monetary values properly serialized from Prisma Decimal to numbers to prevent frontend calculation errors. Features country-specific currency display (USD/$, BDT/৳), negative balance warnings, minimum cash-out validation (BDT 100, USD 5), and masked payout account display for security.
- **Identity Verification System**: Country-specific identity document management with encrypted storage and masking for sensitive data. Bangladesh drivers provide National ID (NID) number and image; USA drivers provide Social Security Number (SSN) and card image. All identity numbers encrypted using AES-256-GCM before storage, with only masked values (last 4 digits) displayed to users. Features country-specific access control (BD drivers cannot access SSN endpoints, US drivers cannot access NID endpoints), edit/save workflow with validation, and integration with KYC completeness checks.
- **US 1099 Tax System**: Complete rideshare driver tax management following IRS 1099-K and 1099-NEC model. Features W-9 form with certification checkbox, automatic earnings categorization into two buckets (trip revenue for 1099-K, non-trip income for 1099-NEC), year-to-date tax totals tracking, and downloadable tax documents. Drivers complete W-9 certification, system automatically categorizes all wallet transactions, and provides tax summaries and document downloads. Backend includes TaxService for calculations, tax summary/document API endpoints, and secure encrypted storage of all tax information. Tax documents are US-driver only with IRS threshold checking ($600 minimum).
- **Bangladesh Tax Reporting System**: Country-specific tax reporting for BD drivers that provides annual income summaries without acting as a tax-filing service. Features conditional rendering based on driver country (US drivers see 1099 forms, BD drivers see BD Tax Summary), aggregated earnings data showing total trip earnings, SafeGo commission, and net payout, downloadable tax summaries for current year (year-to-date) and previous years, and informational disclaimer explaining SafeGo does not file taxes on driver's behalf. Backend includes BDTaxService for aggregating earnings from existing wallet/transaction data, BD tax summary/document API endpoints (BD drivers only), and automatic commission calculation from debit transactions. All amounts displayed in Bangladesh Taka (৳). System respects NBR guidelines and advises drivers to consult local tax professionals.

- **Driver Account Settings & Preferences System**: Comprehensive account management with 11 API endpoints for editing personal information and managing preferences. Features include: (1) Account management endpoints for updating name, email, password, and soft-deleting accounts; (2) GET /api/driver/preferences endpoint returning all driver preference fields; (3) Preference management endpoints for navigation app (google/waze/apple/builtin), work hub (auto-accept rides, long trips, shared rides), privacy (location history, usage analytics, personalized experience), notifications (ride requests, promotions, earnings, support, email weekly, email tips), language (en/bn/es/fr/ar), and theme (light/dark/system); (4) All 11 endpoints use comprehensive Zod validation with safeParse for input sanitization and business rule enforcement; (5) Mutations invalidate appropriate cache segments using TanStack Query v5; (6) Success toasts and error handling with detailed validation feedback; (7) 15 preference fields in Prisma DriverProfile schema: preferredNavigationApp, autoAcceptRides, acceptLongTrips, acceptSharedRides, shareLocationHistory, shareUsageAnalytics, personalizedExperience, notifyRideRequests, notifyPromotions, notifyEarnings, notifySupport, notifyEmailWeekly, notifyEmailTips, preferredLanguage, themePreference.

### Database Schema Design
The schema uses UUID primary keys, indexed foreign keys, decimal types for monetary values, and includes models for `Wallet`, `WalletTransaction`, `Payout`, `PayoutBatch`, `AuditLog`, `AdminNotification`, `PlatformSettings`, `PayoutAccount`, `PaymentMethod`, `OpportunitySetting`, `OpportunityReward`, `DriverTier`, `DriverPoints`, `TierBenefit`, `PointsRule`, and `PointsTransaction`. It supports country-specific identity fields (`nidEncrypted`, `nidImageUrl`, `ssnEncrypted`, `ssnCardImageUrl`, `ssnLast4`) and an `isDemo` flag. Identity numbers are encrypted using AES-256-GCM before storage for security compliance. US tax system fields include `taxCertificationAccepted`, `taxCertificationDate`, `tripRevenueTotalYtd`, `nonTripIncomeTotalYtd`, and `taxYear` in DriverProfile for 1099 tax tracking. Driver preference fields include preferredNavigationApp, autoAcceptRides, acceptLongTrips, acceptSharedRides, shareLocationHistory, shareUsageAnalytics, personalizedExperience, notifyRideRequests, notifyPromotions, notifyEarnings, notifySupport, notifyEmailWeekly, notifyEmailTips, preferredLanguage, and themePreference.
