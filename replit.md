## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend utilizes React 18, TypeScript, Vite 5, shadcn/ui (Radix UI), Tailwind CSS 3, TanStack Query v5, wouter, and React Hook Form with Zod. It employs a custom HSL color palette, Inter/Manrope typography, mobile-first responsive design, skeleton loading, toast notifications, error boundaries, and role-based access controlled routes. Specific features include Uber-level profile experiences, multi-step onboarding, country-specific KYC, a dedicated Food System, and a robust Driver Profile System. Recent enhancements include a professional UI/UX upgrade for the SafeGo Eats restaurant portal, featuring a redesigned header, unified feature placeholders, a comprehensive responsive layout system, and enhanced search and notification UX that is WCAG 2.1 AA compliant.

### Technical Implementations
The backend is built with Node.js 20+, TypeScript, Express.js 4, and Prisma Client 6 with PostgreSQL 14+. Key architectural patterns include:
-   **Generic Service Layer with Role Adapters**: Implements DRY principle with `GenericSupportService<TTicket, TMessage>`, `GenericLiveChatService`, and `GenericSupportCallbackService` classes using `SupportDomainConfig` interface for role-specific configuration. Each role (Restaurant, Driver, Customer, Admin) has dedicated adapter instances that configure Prisma delegates, foreign key fields, and ticket code prefixes while sharing core business logic.

Key systems include:
-   **Admin Capabilities**: Interactive admin panel with dashboard, Document Center, Wallet Settlement, Global Earnings & Payout Analytics, and advanced analytics.
-   **Security & Compliance**: Admin Activity Audit Trail, Global Admin Notification Center, RBAC, secure UX, real-time threat monitoring, and fraud detection.
-   **Wallet & Earnings System**: Manages earnings, commissions, negative balances, and automated/manual payouts.
-   **Tax & Fees System**: Uber-style multi-country tax management with city-level overrides and 7 tax types, including US 1099 Tax System and Bangladesh Tax Reporting System.
-   **Bot-First Support System**: AI-first chat with 4-role support, two-tier escalation, automatic/manual escalation, and an Admin Live Support Console. Includes a comprehensive multi-service support ticket management system.
-   **Multi-Role Support Center**: Production-ready support system extended to Restaurant, Driver, Customer, and Admin roles. Each role has dedicated support ticket/message models, live chat session models, and callback models with proper foreign key relationships. Implements generic service layer with role-specific adapters (restaurantSupportService, driverSupportService, customerSupportService, adminSupportService) for tickets, live chat, and callbacks. Features role-scoped ticket codes (RST-2025-000001, DST-2025-000001, etc.), attachment support, Help Center, and System Status pages, implementing enterprise-grade security with KYC/RBAC gating and audit logging.
-   **Demo Mode**: Comprehensive demo data generation for multi-jurisdiction scenarios.
-   **Opportunity Bonus Management System**: Admin-managed ride incentives with country-specific amounts, campaigns, and zone-based targeting for drivers.
-   **SafeGo Points System**: Uber Pro-style gamified loyalty program with 3 exclusive tiers and 90-day cycles.
-   **Driver Wallet System**: Displays balance, payouts, and transaction timeline, supporting country-specific currencies.
-   **Identity Verification System**: Country-specific identity document management with AES-256-GCM encryption.
-   **Driver Account Settings & Preferences System**: Comprehensive account management with APIs for personal info updates and preference management.
-   **Blocked Riders System**: Allows drivers to block specific customers.
-   **Restaurant Analytics & Management Systems**: Includes Order Analytics & Performance Dashboard, Review & Rating Management, Media Gallery & Branding Management, and Operational Settings System (business hours, delivery/pickup settings, delivery zones, surge pricing).
-   **Relational Menu Category System with Smart Search & Auto-Suggest**: Production-ready, fully relational categorization system for SafeGo Eats restaurant portal featuring 50+ global main categories with 500+ subcategories. Implements proper database normalization with Category, SubCategory, and MenuItemCategory pivot models supporting many-to-many relationships. Backend provides GET /api/restaurant/categories and GET /api/restaurant/subcategories/:categoryId endpoints for dynamic category fetching. POST and PATCH /api/restaurant/menu/items endpoints support both legacy fields (primaryCategory, subCategories) and new relational fields (mainCategoryId FK, subCategoryIds via pivot) with transaction-based updates ensuring data consistency. All API endpoints (GET list/detail, POST create, PATCH update) include intelligent response serialization that exposes both relation objects (mainCategory, subCategoryLinks) and flattened identifiers (mainCategoryId, subCategoryIds) for optimal frontend consumption. Includes idempotent seed script generating 50 main categories (Appetizers, Main Courses, Desserts, Beverages, Salads, Soups, etc.) and ~10 subcategories each using slug-based unique identifiers. Frontend forms feature Smart Category Search with real-time in-memory filtering, text highlighting for matches, and hierarchical category/subcategory navigation. Auto-Suggest engine analyzes menu item titles and descriptions using keyword matching with synonym support (burgers, pizza, biryani, etc.) to suggest relevant categories with high/medium/low confidence levels, enabling one-click category application. All search and suggestion logic runs client-side with zero additional server round-trips, optimized for mobile performance with 500+ subcategories. Menu list page includes dual-level filtering by main category and subcategory. Maintains full backwards compatibility with nullable legacy fields for safe migration.

-   **Payment & Payout Configuration System**: Enterprise-grade implementation for managing customer payment methods and payout rails by country, service type, actor type, and KYC level. Features anti-spoofing measures, AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive metadata, country/provider/KYC validation, and full audit logging for all operations.
-   **Unified Payout System**: Production-ready payout infrastructure for **individual withdrawals only** across all user roles (Restaurant, Driver, Customer) with unified `/api/payout/*` routes protected by RBAC. **FROZEN IN CURRENT STATE** - implements individual payout capabilities only; batch processing intentionally not implemented per user decision. Features include: automatic weekly payout scheduling, bank verification service with Bangladesh (NID/Passport + business license) and USA (SSN/EIN + routing validation) KYC rules, country-specific minimum payout amounts (BD: ৳100, US: $10, others: $20), payout method management (bank_transfer, mobile_money via bKash/Nagad/Rocket, Stripe Connect), comprehensive withdrawal request validation with active method selection, full transaction history with audit trails, KYC-gated access control, graceful error handling for pending verification states, and seamless integration with existing Wallet + Earnings infrastructure maintaining backwards compatibility. Restaurant payout UI fully implemented with methods management (`/restaurant/payout-methods`) and withdrawal interface (`/restaurant/payouts-history`).
